    """
    Conditionally prompts the user to type some text based on the 'requires_input' flag
    and returns whatever they typed or a predefined message. ONLY CALL THIS FUNCTION IF YOU ABSOLUTELY NEED INPUT FROM THE USER. First determine if you can fulfill their request on your own using the other available tools, if you determined you absolutely need input from the human to fulfill their request, then proceed, and interact with the human. 
    Note: If you are giving instructions to gather information, be sure to instruct the human to provide you the information so you may give the final answer.
    Parameters:
    - requires_input (int): Flag to determine if user input is needed (1) or not (0).
    - input_text (str, optional): Question to ask the user to gather additional information that is needed.

    Returns:
    - str: The user input response to your question or a predefined message.
