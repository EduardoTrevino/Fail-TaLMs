Kraken\n4. Huobi\n5. Bittrex\n6. Bitfinex\n7. OKEx\n8. Bitstamp\n9. Gemini\n10. eToro\n\nAs for retrieving trading pairs for a specific chain and its pair addresses, it's a bit more complex. Each exchange has its own API, and the specific endpoint for retrieving trading pairs can vary. However, I can provide you with some examples of how to retrieve trading pairs for a specific chain and its pair addresses using the APIs of some of the exchanges listed above.\n\n1. Binance:\n\nYou can use the Binance API to retrieve trading pairs for a specific chain and its pair addresses. Here's an example of how to do it:\n\n- First, you need to get the list of all trading pairs on Binance. You can do this by calling the `GET /api/v3/exchangeInfo` endpoint.\n- Then, you can filter the list of trading pairs by the chain you're interested in. For example, if you're interested in the Ethereum chain, you can filter the list by the `symbol` field, which contains the trading pair symbol (e.g. `ETHUSDT`).\n- Once you have the list of trading pairs for the specific chain, you can retrieve the pair addresses by calling the `GET /api/v3/account` endpoint with the `symbol` parameter set to the trading pair symbol.\n\nHere's an example of how to do it in Python:\n```\nimport requests\n\n# Set API key and secret\napi_key = \"YOUR_API_KEY\"\napi_secret = \"YOUR_API_SECRET\"\n\n# Set the chain you're interested in\nchain = \"ETH\"\n\n# Get the list of all trading pairs on Binance\nresponse = requests.get(\"https://api.binance.com/api/v3/exchangeInfo\")\ntrading_pairs = response.json()[\"symbols\"]\n\n# Filter the list of trading pairs by the chain\neth_trading_pairs = [pair for pair in trading_pairs if pair[\"symbol\"].startswith(chain)]\n\n# Retrieve the pair addresses for each trading pair\nfor pair in eth_trading_pairs:\n    response = requests.get(f\"https://api.binance.com/api/v3/account?symbol={pair['symbol']}\", headers={\"X-MBX-APIKEY\": api_key, \"X-MBX-SECRET-KEY\": api_secret})\n    pair_addresses = response.json()[\"balances\"]\n    print(f\"Pair: {pair['symbol']}, Pair addresses: {pair_addresses}\")\n```\n2. Coinbase:\n\nYou can use the Coinbase API to retrieve trading pairs for a specific chain and its pair addresses. Here's an example of how to do it:\n\n- First, you need to get the list of all trading pairs on Coinbase. You can do this by calling the `GET /products` endpoint.\n- Then, you can filter the list of trading pairs by the chain you're interested in. For example, if you're interested in the Ethereum chain, you can filter the list by the `id` field, which contains the trading pair ID (e.g. `ETH-USD`).\n- Once you have the list of trading pairs for the specific chain, you can retrieve the pair addresses by calling the `GET /accounts/{account_id}/addresses` endpoint with the `account_id` parameter set to the account ID of the trading pair.\n\nHere's an example of how to do it in Python:\n```\nimport requests\n\n# Set API key and secret\napi_key = \"YOUR_API_KEY\"\napi_secret = \"YOUR_API_SECRET\"\n\n# Set the chain you're interested in\nchain = \"ETH\"\n\n# Get the list of all trading pairs on Coinbase\nresponse = requests.get(\"https://api.coinbase.com/v2/products\")\ntrading_pairs = response.json()[\"data\"]\n\n# Filter the list of trading pairs by the chain\neth_trading_pairs = [pair for pair in trading_pairs if pair[\"id\"].startswith(chain)]\n\n# Retrieve the pair addresses for each trading pair\nfor pair in eth_trading_pairs:\n    response = requests.get(f\"https://api.coinbase.com/v2/accounts/{pair['id']}/addresses\", headers={\"Authorization\": f\"Bearer {api_key}\"})\n    pair_addresses = response.json()[\"data\"]\n    print(f\"Pair: {pair['id']}, Pair addresses: {pair_addresses}\")\n```\nNote that these are just examples, and you should replace `YOUR_API_KEY` and `YOUR_API_SECRET` with your actual API key and secret.\n\nAlso, keep in mind that each exchange has its own rate limits and requirements for API usage, so be sure to check the exchange's documentation before using their API.\n\nFinish(\"The final answer is: You can use the Binance API and Coinbase API to retrieve trading pairs for a specific chain and its pair addresses.

You will need to create an account on Gemini and obtain an API key. Once you have the API key, you can use it to make API calls to retrieve the trading data.\n\nHere is an example of how you can use the Gemini API to retrieve the 15-minute interval trading data for BTC/USD:\n\n1. First, you need to import the required libraries. You will need the `requests` library to make API calls and the `pandas` library to handle the data.\n2. Next, you need to set your API key and the base URL for the Gemini API.\n3. Then, you can use the `requests` library to make a GET request to the Gemini API to retrieve the trading data. You will need to specify the symbol (BTCUSD), the interval (15 minutes), and the limit (the number of data points you want to retrieve).\n4. After making the API call, you can use the `pandas` library to convert the response into a DataFrame.\n5. Finally, you can print the DataFrame to see the trading data.\n\nHere is an example of how you can use the N.exchange API to retrieve the price history for Bitcoin to Litecoin exchange over the last hour:\n\n1. First, you need to import the required libraries. You will need the `requests` library to make API calls and the `pandas` library to handle the data.\n2. Next, you need to set your API key and the base URL for the N.exchange API.\n3. Then, you can use the `requests` library to make a GET request to the N.exchange API to retrieve the price history. You will need to specify the symbol (BTC_LTC), the interval (1 hour), and the limit (the number of data points you want to retrieve).\n4.

Additionally, you should always handle errors and exceptions properly when making API calls.\n\nIn summary, to retrieve the 15-minute interval trading data for BTC/USD on Gemini and the price history for Bitcoin to Litecoin exchange on N.exchange over the last hour, you can use the Gemini API and the N.exchange API respectively.
