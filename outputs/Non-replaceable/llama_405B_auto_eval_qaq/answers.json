Skip to expert mode 1) Make the Sign of the Cross saying \u201cIn the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.\u201d, and say the Apostles\u2019 Creed: \u201cI believe in God, the Father almighty creator of heaven and earth and in Jesus Christ, His only Son, our Lord, who was conceived by the Holy Spirit, born of the Virgin Mary, suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, died, and was buried. He descended into hell. On the third day he rose again from the dead. He ascended into heaven and is seated at the right hand of God, the Father almighty. He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead. I believe in the Holy Spirit, the Holy Catholic Church, the communion of saints, the forgiveness of sins, the resurrection of the body, and life everlasting.

Give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us; and lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. Amen.\u201d 3) Say three Hail Marys for Faith, Hope, and Charity: \u201cHail Mary, full of grace. The Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou among women, And blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. Holy Mary, Mother of God, Pray for us sinners, Now and at the hour of our death. Amen.\u201d \u2013 3 times. 4) Say the Glory Be: \u201cGlory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit.

The time for the Incarnation is at hand. Of all women God prepared Mary from her conception to be the Mother of the Incarnate Word. The Angel Gabriel announces: \u201cHail, full of grace! The Lord is with thee.\u201d Mary wonders at this salutation. The Angel assures her: \u201cFear not . . . you shall conceive in your womb, and give birth to a Son.\u201d Mary is troubled for she has made a vow of virginity. The Angel answers that she will conceive by the power of the Holy Spirit, and her Son will be called the Son of God. The Incarnation awaits Mary\u2019s consent. Mary answers: \u201cBehold the handmaid of the Lord. Be it done unto me according to your word.\u201d The Word was made flesh and dwelt among us Spiritual Fruit: Humility 7) Glory Be Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit. As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be, world without end. Amen. Oh My Jesus O my Jesus, forgive us our sins. Save us from the fires of hell. Lead all souls into heaven, especially those in most need of thy mercy. Amen. The Second Joyful Mystery \u2013 The Visitation 8) Announce \u201cThe Second Joyful Mystery \u2013 The Visitation\u201d and then say the Our Father. Say ten Hail Marys while meditating on the Mystery. Mary\u2019s cousin Elizabeth conceived a son in her old age\u2026 for nothing is impossible with God. Charity prompts Mary to hasten to visit Elizabeth in the hour of her need. The journey to Elizabeth\u2019s home is about eighty miles requiring four or five days. Though long and arduous, the journey is joyous, for Mary bears with her the Incarnate Word. At Mary\u2019s salutation, John the Baptist is sanctified in his mother\u2019s womb. Elizabeth exclaims: \u201cBlessed are you among women, and blessed is the fruit of your womb.\u201d \u201cHow have I deserved that the mother of my Lord should come to me?\u201d \u201cBlessed is she who believed that the Lord\u2019s words to her would be fulfilled.\u201d Mary replies: \u201cMy soul proclaims the greatness of the Lord, and my spirit finds joy in God my Savior.\u201d Mary serves her cousin in all humility for three months until the birth of John the Baptist. Spiritual Fruit: Love of Neighbor Glory Be Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit. As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be, world without end. Amen. Oh My Jesus O my Jesus, forgive us our sins. Save us from the fires of hell. Lead all souls into heaven, especially those in most need of thy mercy. Amen. The Third Joyful Mystery \u2013 The Nativity of Our Lord Announce \u201cThe Third Joyful Mystery \u2013 The Nativity of Our Lord\u201d and then say the Our Father. Say ten Hail Marys while meditating on the Mystery. Joseph and Mary go to Bethlehem to comply with the decree of Caesar Augustus. The hour for Mary to give birth is near, but there is no room in the inn. In the stillness of the night, the Savior is born in a cave, Mary remaining a Virgin. She wraps Him in swaddling clothes and lays Him in a manger. In unspeakable joy Mary gathers to her bosom the Flower of her virginity. Jesus enters the world in poverty to teach the lesson of detachment from earthly things. The angel announces to the shepherds: \u201cToday there is born to you in the town of David a Savior, Who is Christ the Lord.\u201d The angelic chorus sing: \u201cGlory to God in the highest, and peace to His people on earth.\u201d The shepherds come to the stable to pay homage to the Infant Jesus. The Magi come to adore the Holy Child and offer Him gifts. Spiritual Fruit: Detachment Glory Be Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit. As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be, world without end. Amen. Oh My Jesus O my Jesus, forgive us our sins. Save us from the fires of hell. Lead all souls into heaven, especially those in most need of thy mercy. Amen. The Fourth Joyful Mystery \u2013 The Presentation Announce \u201cThe Fourth Joyful Mystery \u2013 The Presentation\u201d and then say the Our Father. Say ten Hail Marys while meditating on the Mystery. Observing the law of Moses they take Jesus to the Temple to present Him to the Lord. According to the Law the firstborn male child of every family should be consecrated to the Lord. Mary offers her Son to the Father, then ransoms Him back at the price paid by the poor. Jesus is not subject to the law of Moses, yet to teach obedience, submits to it. Mary is not subject to the law of purification, yet in humility she submits to it. God had revealed to Simeon that he would not see death until he had seen the Messiah. Recognizing the Child, he prays: \u201cNow you can dismiss your servant in peace. You have fulfilled your word.\u201d \u201cThis Child is destined to be the downfall and rise of many in Israel, a sign that will be opposed.\u201d And to Mary Simeon reveals: \u201cAnd your own soul a sword shall pierce.\u201d After they fulfill all the Law requires they return to Nazareth. Spiritual Fruit: Obedience Glory Be Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit. As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be, world without end. Amen. Oh My Jesus O my Jesus, forgive us our sins. Save us from the fires of hell. Lead all souls into heaven, especially those in most need of thy mercy. Amen. The Fifth Joyful Mystery \u2013 Finding Jesus in the Temple Announce \u201cThe Fifth Joyful Mystery \u2013 Finding Jesus in the Temple\u201d and then say the Our Father. Say ten Hail Marys while meditating on the Mystery. When Jesus is twelve years old, He goes with His parents to Jerusalem for the feast of the Passover. After the feast of the Passover, Joseph and Mary unknowingly set out for Nazareth without Jesus. At the end of the first day\u2019s journey they discover Jesus is missing. His parents return immediately looking for Him. This loss causes grief and anxiety beyond our understanding to the hearts of Mary and Joseph. On the third day, they find Jesus in the Temple among the Doctors who were astonished at His wisdom. Mary: \u201cSon, why have you done this to us? Your father and I have been searching for You in sorrow.\u201d Jesus: \u201cWhy did you search for Me? Did you not know that I must be about My Father\u2019s business?\u201d Jesus goes down with them to Nazareth, and is subject to them. Mary keeps all these things in her heart. Spiritual Fruit: Perseverance Glory Be Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit. As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be, world without end. Amen. Oh My Jesus O my Jesus, forgive us our sins. Save us from the fires of hell. Lead all souls into heaven, especially those in most need of thy mercy. Amen. Closing Prayers Hail"
