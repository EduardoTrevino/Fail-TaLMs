He is portrayed by actor Mark Hamill. Luke is the son of Anakin Skywalker (Darth Vader) and Padm\u00e9 Amidala, and the twin brother of Princess Leia Organa. Introduced in the original 1977 film \"Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope,\" Luke becomes a pivotal figure in the Rebel Alliance\u2019s struggle against the Galactic Empire.

Prayers for today, which is Saturday, typically focus on the Joyful Mysteries.\n\n1. **Sign of the Cross**: In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.\n2. **Apostles' Creed**: I believe in God, the Father Almighty, Creator of Heaven and earth; and in Jesus Christ, his only Son our Lord...\n3. **Our Father**: Our Father, Who art in heaven, hallowed be Thy name...\n4. **Hail Mary** (\u00d73): Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee...\n5. **Glory Be**: Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit...\n6. **The Mysteries**:\n   - First Joyful Mystery: The Annunciation\n   - Second Joyful Mystery: The Visitation\n   - Third Joyful Mystery: The Nativity of Our Lord\n   - Fourth Joyful Mystery: The Presentation of Jesus in the Temple\n   - Fifth Joyful Mystery: The Finding of Jesus in the Temple\n   - (For each mystery: Our Father, 10 Hail Marys, Glory Be, and Fatima Prayer)\n7. **Hail Holy Queen**: Hail, holy Queen, Mother of Mercy, our life, our sweetness, and our hope...\n\nThis is a concise guideline of how the rosary is prayed, with emphasis on the Joyful Mysteries for Saturday. \n\nSince I have provided the requested information, I will now conclude the task.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"final_answer\": \"Luke Skywalker is a central character in the Star Wars saga, portrayed by Mark Hamill.
