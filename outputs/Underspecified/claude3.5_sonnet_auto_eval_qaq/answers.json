Chinese characters with Kangxi radical number 85:\nThe Kangxi radical number 85 is associated with the water radical (\u6c34). There are numerous characters that use this radical, including:\n\n\u6c34 (water)\n\u6c5f (river)\n\u6cb3 (river)\n\u6e56 (lake)\n\u6d77 (sea)\n\u6d41 (flow)\n\u6d6a (wave)\n\u6cf3 (swim)\n\u6d17 (wash)\n\u6e05 (clear)\n\nThese are just a few examples from the extensive list of characters using this radical. The water radical is one of the most common radicals in Chinese writing and is used in many characters related to liquids, bodies of water, and water-related actions.\n\n2. Definition of the English word 'radical':\nThe word 'radical' has multiple meanings depending on the context. Here are some key definitions:\n\na) As a noun:\n- A person with radical opinions or who favors fundamental change.\n- In chemistry, a group of atoms joined by covalent bonds that take part in reactions as a single unit.\n- In mathematics, a root of a number or quantity.\n- In Chinese writing systems, the portion of a character that provides an indication of its meaning (which is relevant to our discussion about Kangxi radicals).\n\nb) As an adjective:\n- Favoring fundamental change or change at the root cause of a matter.\n- Pertaining to the basic or intrinsic nature of something.\n- Thoroughgoing or far-reaching.\n- In informal usage (especially in the 1980s and 1990s), meaning excellent or awesome.\n\nIn the context of Chinese characters, the term 'radical' refers to the root component of a character that often provides a clue to its meaning or pronunciation. The Kangxi radicals, including the water radical (number 85) we discussed, are a set of 214 radicals that serve as the primary means of classifying and indexing Chinese characters in dictionaries.",

Chinese characters with Kangxi radical number 85:\nThe Kangxi radical number 85 is associated with water-related characters. Some examples of characters with this radical include: \u6c34 (water), \u6c5f (river), \u6cb3 (river), \u6d77 (sea), \u6d0b (ocean), \u6d41 (flow), \u6ce2 (wave), \u6e56 (lake), and many more. In total, there are over 1,000 characters that use this radical, as it's one of the most common and productive radicals in Chinese writing.\n\n2. Definition of \"radical\":\nAs an English word, \"radical\" has several meanings depending on the context:\n\nAs a noun:\n- In Chinese characters: A radical is the portion of a character that provides an indication of its meaning, as opposed to its phonetic component. This relates directly to the Kangxi radicals we discussed earlier.\n- In politics: A person with extreme or progressive political views.\n- In mathematics: The root of a number or quantity.\n- In chemistry: A group of atoms behaving as a unit in a compound.\n\nAs an adjective:\n- Favoring fundamental or extreme change; far-reaching or thorough.\n- Relating to the root or origin of something.\n- In slang (especially in the 1980s and 1990s): Excellent or awesome.\n\nThe word \"radical\" comes from the Latin \"radix,\" meaning \"root,\" which explains its connection to fundamental or root-level concepts across various fields.\n\nIt's interesting to note how the concept of \"radical\" connects between the Chinese writing system and its English definition, both relating to the fundamental or root elements of a system.",
