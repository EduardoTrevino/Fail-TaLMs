root (of a number or quantity). It also designates the part of a character in logographic writing systems that indicates its meaning or a set of consonants that make up a root in Semitic languages. As an adjective, it describes favoring fundamental change or belonging to the basic nature of something, and is used to describe operations or surgeries that are thoroughgoing. Furthermore, it refers to parts of mathematics, chemistry, and linguistics involving root, radix, or free radicals. In slang, it can also mean excellent or awesome.",

He lives with his wife and four little foxes. In order to feed his family, he steals food from the cruel, brutish farmers named Boggis, Bunce, and Bean every night.\n\n  Finally tired of being constantly outwitted by Mr. Fox, the farmers attempt to capture and kill him. The foxes escape in time by burrowing deep into the ground. The farmers decide to wait outside the hole for the foxes to emerge. Unable to leave the hole and steal food, Mr. Fox and his family begin to starve. Mr. Fox devises a plan to steal food from the farmers by tunneling into the ground and borrowing into the farmer's houses.\n\n  Aided by a friendly Badger, the animals bring the stolen food back and Mrs. Fox prepares a great celebratory banquet attended by the other starving animals and their families. Mr. Fox invites all the animals to live with him underground and says that he will provide food for them daily thanks to his underground passages.
