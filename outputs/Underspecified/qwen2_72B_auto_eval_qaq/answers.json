This book covers optimization techniques for machine learning and machine learning for optimization.\n\n3. \"Automated Machine Learning for Business\" by Kai R. Larsen and Daniel S. Becker, published by Oxford University Press. This chapter explains why automated machine learning is important and covers various aspects of the field.\n\n4. \"Phase Transitions in Machine Learning\" edited by various authors, published by Cambridge University Press. This book includes a chapter on machine learning.\n\n5. \"Bayesian Reasoning and Machine Learning\" by David Barber, published by Cambridge University Press. This book includes chapters on machine learning concepts and Bayesian reasoning in the context of machine learning.\n\nUnfortunately, I was unable to obtain the TV schedule for channel CT1 on August 4, 2024, due to issues with the API.",
