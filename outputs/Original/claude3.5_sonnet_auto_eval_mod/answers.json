    "model_answer": "I've completed both tasks for you:\n\n1. Van Gogh Artworks from the Art Institute of Chicago:\n   I found five notable works by Van Gogh in the collection:\n   - \"The Bedroom\" (ID: 28560): His famous painting of his room in Arles.\n   - \"Self-Portrait\" (ID: 80607): Showing Van Gogh with his characteristic red hair and beard.\n   - \"The Poet's Garden\" (ID: 14586): A landscape with trees and a yellow sky.\n   - \"A Peasant Woman Digging in Front of Her Cottage\" (ID: 28862): Depicting a woman working in front of a thatched-roof building.\n   - \"The Drinkers\" (ID: 79349): A scene with three men and a smaller figure drinking outdoors.\n\n2. Pixel-Art Style Avatar:\n   I've generated a pixel-art style avatar using 'ArtLover' as the seed. The avatar is in SVG format, which allows for high-quality scaling. The image features a character with:\n   - Light skin tone\n   - Dark hair with a unique style\n   - Large eyes\n   - A yellow shirt or collar\n   - A simple, charming pixel art style true to the requested aesthetic\n\nYou can use this avatar as a profile picture or in any digital context where you want a unique, artistic representation. The SVG format ensures it will look crisp at any size.\n\nThese results combine Van Gogh's artistic legacy with a modern, digital art form, perfectly embodying the 'ArtLover' theme!",
