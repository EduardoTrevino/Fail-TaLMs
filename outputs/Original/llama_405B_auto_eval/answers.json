The show's heavy Western influence struck a chord with American viewers, where it became a \"gateway drug\" to anime aimed at adult audiences. The TV show Breaking Bad is a scripted drama, crime, and thriller series that aired from 2008 to 2019. It has a rating of 9.2 and has been scored by 98 users. The show follows the story of Walter White, a chemistry teacher who is diagnosed with Stage III cancer and given a prognosis of two years left to live. With a new sense of fearlessness based on his medical prognosis, and a desire to secure his family's financial security, White chooses to enter a dangerous world of drugs and crime and ascends to power in this world. The series explores how a fatal diagnosis such as White's releases a typical man from the daily concerns and constraints of normal society and follows his transformation from mild family man to a kingpin of the drug trade.\"}</function>",
