Additionally, I can use the 'get_asset_info' function to list available trading assets on Kraken by specifying the 'aclass' parameter as 'currency'. Thus, I will finish with the final answer.\n\nTo do so, I will use the relevant part of the 'get_venues' function to first list venues near New York City accepting cryptocurrency. Then, I will call the 'get_asset_info' function on Kraken to get the available trading assets.\n\nHere is the code for these steps:\n\n```python\nget_venues(lat1='40.7128', lat2='40.7129', lon1='-74.0060', lon2='-74.0061', query='', category='cryptocurrency', owner='', upvoter='', before='', after='', promoted=False, limit=1000, offset=0, mode='json')\nasset_info = get_asset_info(asset='', aclass='currency')\nFinish(final_answer='Venues accepting cryptocurrency near New York City: [' + ', '.join([v['name'] for v in get_venues(lat1='40.7128', lat2='40.7129', lon1='-74.0060', lon2='-74.0061', query='', category='cryptocurrency', owner='', upvoter='', before='', after='', promoted=False, limit=1000, offset=0, mode='json')])\nFinish(final_answer='Trading assets on Kraken: ' + ', '.join([asset for asset in asset_info]))\n```\n\nThese lines of code should display the list of venues accepting cryptocurrency near New York City and the available trading assets on Kraken.",
