Isn't it also great when friends visit from distant places? If people do not know you and you do not resent it, aren't you a true gentleman?\"\n- You Zi said, \"Few who are filial and respectful towards their parents will like to offend their superiors; there has never been one who disliked offending superiors yet liked creating disorder. A gentleman focuses on the foundation; when the foundation is established, the Way comes forth. Filial piety and brotherly respect are the foundation of benevolence.\"\n- The Master said, \"Clever words and a plausible appearance are seldom associated with true virtue!\"\n- Zeng Zi said, \"I examine myself three times a day: whether I have been unfaithful when planning for others, whether I have been untrustworthy when dealing with friends, and whether I have practiced what has been passed on to me.\"\n- The Master said, \"To govern a country of a thousand chariots, there must be reverent attention to business, sincerity, economy in expenditure, and love for the people, and the employment of them at the proper seasons.\"\n- The Master said, \"A young man should be filial when at home, and respectful to elders when away. He should be earnest and trustworthy, broadly loving towards others, and close to benevolence. If he has any energy left, he should study the Arts.\"\n- Zi Xia said, \"If a person values virtue more than beauty, exhausts their strength serving their parents, dedicates their life to serving their ruler, and is trustworthy in friendships, I will say this person has learned.\"\n- The Master said, \"A gentleman is serious and not arrogant; diligence in learning makes his knowledge firm. He prioritizes loyalty and trust; he has no friends who are not his equals. If he has made a mistake, he does not fear to correct it.\"\n- Zeng Zi said, \"When attending to the funeral of a parent, and following them in death with the proper rites, the virtue of the people will grow.\"\n- A disciple of Confucius, Zi Qin, asked the Master\u2019s disciple Zi Gong: \u201cWhen our Master goes to a country, he always finds out about its government. Does he ask for this information? Or is it given him?\u201d Zi Gong said: \u201cOur Master gets it by being friendly, honest, respectful, frugal, and humble. The way our Master asks for information\u2014is it not different from other people\u2019s way of asking?\u201d\n- The Master said, \"While a father is alive, observe his son's intentions. When the father is dead, observe his son's actions. If for three years he does not change from the way of his father, he can be called filial.\"\n- You Zi said, \"Of the functions of propriety, harmony is the most valuable. This is what was done in the ways of the ancient kings\u2014this is the beauty. When things are done in a small way, it creates chaos and disorder. Thus it is that knowing harmony without propriety is insufficient.\"\n- You Zi said, \"Trustworthiness for others is close to righteousness, words can be followed, being respectful is close to propriety, which keeps one away from disgrace. Maintaining old relationships with family is also important.\"\n- The Master said, \"A gentleman, in regard to what he eats or where he lives, does not seek to be full or comfortable; he is quick in actions and cautious in speech; he stays on the path of right conduct and corrects his errors. This is what one might call a person who loves to learn.\"\n- Zi Gong said, \"What about being poor without complaining and being rich without being proud?\" The Master said, \"Acceptable. But it's not as good as being poor yet happy, rich yet courteous.\" Zi Gong said, \"As it is said in the Book of Poetry: 'Like carving and polishing ivory, cutting and grinding stone.' Is this what you mean?\" The Master said, \"Si, you can now discuss poetry with me. Let me tell you what has passed and what is to come.\"\n- The Master said, \"I am not concerned that people do not recognize me; I am concerned that I do not recognize them.\"\n\n### Definition of \"Philosophy\"\n\n1. **The love of wisdom.**\n2. **An academic discipline that seeks truth through reasoning rather than empiricism.**\n   - Example: *Philosophy is often divided into five major branches: logic, metaphysics, epistemology, ethics, and aesthetics.*\n3. **A comprehensive system of belief.**\n4. **A view or outlook regarding fundamental principles underlying some domain.**\n   - Example: *A philosophy of government; a philosophy of education.*\n5. **A general principle (usually moral).**\n6. **A broader branch of (non-applied) science.**\n7. **A calm and thoughtful demeanor; calmness of temper.**\n\nFor pronunciation, you can listen to it [here](https://api.dictionaryapi.dev/media/pronunciations/en/philosophy-us.mp3).\n\nSource: [Wiktionary](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/philosophy)",
