They allow users to buy and sell cryptocurrencies using cash at physical locations, making it easier for people to enter the cryptocurrency market without needing to use online exchanges.\n\nThis information shows that there's a robust ecosystem of both online exchanges and physical ATMs supporting the cryptocurrency market, providing various options for users to buy, sell, and trade digital assets.",

This suggests that the gold price might be a projected or scheduled price for September 20, 2024.\n\nThe ETHUSD market on Kraken appears to be very liquid with a narrow spread, which is good for traders.
