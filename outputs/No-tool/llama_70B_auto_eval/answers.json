Use the exchange's API to retrieve the list of available trading pairs.\n4. Filter the trading pairs by the specific chain you're interested in (e.g., Ethereum, Bitcoin, etc.).\n5. Retrieve the pair addresses for each trading pair.\n\nHere's an example using the Binance API:\n\n**Binance API Example:**\n\n1. Create a Binance account and obtain an API key and secret key.\n2. Use the `GET /api/v3/exchangeInfo` endpoint to retrieve the list of available trading pairs.\n3. Filter the trading pairs by the Ethereum chain (e.g., `ETH`).\n4. Use the `GET /api/v3/ticker/price` endpoint to retrieve the pair addresses for each Ethereum trading pair.\n\nHere's some sample Python code using the `requests` library:\n```python\nimport requests\n\n# Set API key and secret key\napi_key = \"YOUR_API_KEY\"\napi_secret = \"YOUR_API_SECRET\"\n\n# Set exchange and chain\nexchange = \"binance\"\nchain = \"ETH\"\n\n# Retrieve list of trading pairs\nresponse = requests.get(f\"https://api.{exchange}.com/api/v3/exchangeInfo\")\ntrading_pairs = response.json()[\"symbols\"]\n\n# Filter trading pairs by chain\neth_trading_pairs = [pair for pair in trading_pairs if pair[\"baseAsset\"] == chain]\n\n# Retrieve pair addresses for each trading pair\npair_addresses = []\nfor pair in eth_trading_pairs:\n    response = requests.get(f\"https://api.{exchange}.com/api/v3/ticker/price\", params={\"symbol\": pair[\"symbol\"]})\n    pair_addresses.append(response.json()[\"pairAddress\"])\n\nprint(pair_addresses)\n```\nNote that this is just an example and may not work as-is.
