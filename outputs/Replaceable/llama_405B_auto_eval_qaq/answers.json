The franchise began with the release of the original Star Wars film in 1977, which was later subtitled Episode IV: A New Hope. The film was a groundbreaking achievement in special effects and storytelling, and it quickly became a cultural phenomenon. The success of the original film led to the creation of two more films, The Empire Strikes Back (1980) and Return of the Jedi (1983), which completed the original trilogy. In the 1990s, a prequel trilogy was released, consisting of The Phantom Menace (1999), Attack of the Clones (2002), and Revenge of the Sith (2005). The prequels were met with mixed reviews from fans and critics, but they still performed well at the box office. In 2012, Lucasfilm was acquired by The Walt Disney Company, which led to the creation of a new sequel trilogy. The sequel trilogy consists of The Force Awakens (2015), The Last Jedi (2017), and The Rise of Skywalker (2019). The sequel trilogy has been well-received by fans and critics, and it has helped to revitalize the franchise. In addition to the episodic films, the Star Wars franchise has also expanded to include several spin-off films, including Rogue One: A Star Wars Story (2016) and Solo: A Star Wars Story (2018). The Star Wars API provides access to a vast array of data on the films, including character information, planet data, and vehicle specifications. The API is a valuable resource for fans and developers who want to explore the Star Wars universe in more detail.

The planet's atmosphere is also quite thin, making it difficult for humans and other species to breathe without proper protection. The rosary prayer for Monday is the Joyful Mysteries.
