He becomes a hero of the Rebel Alliance, and is central to the overall story of the original trilogy. Luke is heir to a family of powerful Force-sensitives. His father, Anakin Skywalker, is a Jedi Knight who was seduced by the dark side of the Force and became the Sith Lord Darth Vader. Luke\\u2019s mother, Shmi Skywalker, is a slave who is strong in the Force and is the one who begins to reveal the ways of the Force to Anakin. Luke\\u2019s journey as a hero of the Rebel Alliance begins when he encounters Obi-Wan Kenobi, an old Jedi Knight who had been hiding in exile on Tatooine. Obi-Wan reveals to Luke that his father was a Jedi Knight who was killed by Darth Vader, and begins to teach Luke the ways of the Force. Luke then embarks on a journey to rescue a princess, confront the evil Empire, and ultimately confront Darth Vader and the Emperor. Throughout the original trilogy, Luke faces many challenges and struggles as he navigates his role as a hero of the Rebel Alliance and as a Jedi Knight. He must confront the harsh realities of war and the moral complexities of using the Force. Ultimately, Luke emerges as a powerful Jedi Knight who plays a key role in the defeat of the Empire and the redemption of his father. Luke\\u2019s character arc is one of growth and self-discovery, as he learns to navigate the complexities of the Force and to find his place in the galaxy.
