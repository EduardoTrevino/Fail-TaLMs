A list of all decentralized exchanges supported on the Binance Smart Chain network.\n\nFor the first part, I can use my general knowledge to identify some of the top Ethereum exchanges. However, I'll also rely on the available tools for more accurate information.\n\nThe second part requires identifying decentralized exchanges supported on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) network. Fortunately, the tool 'get_supported_dexes' function can be used to fetch this information.\n\nThe process will be as follows:\n\n- Use the 'get_supported_dexes' tool to get a list of supported decentralized exchanges on the BSC network.\n- Use the general knowledge part to complement the information with at least a few well-known Ethereum exchanges, because that is all the specific information I have been able to gather about Ethereum exchanges provided in this query\n- Combine the results to provide a well-rounded answer.\n\nOverall, I have all the necessary information to answer the query from my knowledge and the availability of tools, so I'll attempt to answer it.",

I find the day for which the user wants the rosary prayer, which is Monday. So, I will pass Monday as a parameter to the 'get_prayer_by_day' function to get the rosary prayer for Monday.\n\nThe rosary prayer for Monday is the \"Luminous Mysteries.\"",
