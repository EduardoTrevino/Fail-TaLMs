When referring to the prayer, the word is usually capitalized as the \"Rosary,\" and it is sometimes written in its plural form, \"Rosaries,\" to indicate the recitation of multiple Rosary prayers. It involves the repetition of the Lord's Prayer (also known as the Our Father), the Hail Mary, and the Glory Be, with a series of meditations upon the mysteries of the lives of Jesus Christ and the Virgin Mary.\n\n#### Structure of the Rosary:\n- **The Prayers:** \n    - The Apostles' Creed\n    - The Our Father (at the start of each decade)\n    - The Hail Mary (ten times for each decade)\n    - The Glory Be\n    - The Fatima Prayer (in some versions)\n\n- **The Mysteries:** \n    - Joyful Mysteries \n    - Sorrowful Mysteries \n    - Glorious Mysteries \n    - Luminous Mysteries (added by Pope John Paul II in 2002)\n\nEach set of mysteries is prayed on specific days:\n- Joyful: Mondays and Saturdays\n- Sorrowful: Tuesdays and Fridays\n- Glorious: Wednesdays and Sundays\n- Luminous: Thursdays\n\n#### History:\nThe exact origins of the Rosary are obscure, but it is traditionally believed to have been revealed to Saint Dominic in the 13th century. It was developed over time into the form most commonly practiced today, which was codified by Pope Pius V in 1569.\n\n#### Significance:\nThe Rosary is a deeply meditative prayer that encourages Catholics to reflect on the key events in the life of Jesus and Mary. It is often prayed in private, but can also be recited in groups, especially in times of special need or communal prayer.\n\n---\n\nNext, I will use the tool to provide today's rosary prayer.\n\nCalling the tool to get today's rosary prayer...\n\n",

Bands like My Bloody Valentine and Slowdive are iconic in this genre. The name \"shoegaze\" came from the musicians' tendency to look down at their shoes on stage while playing intricate effects pedals.\n\n2. **Vaporwave**: Emerging in the early 2010s, vaporwave is deeply rooted in Internet culture. It is known for its nostalgic vibe, heavy use of slowed-down samples from 80s and 90s media, and aesthetic themes often incorporating retro computer graphics. Notable example artists include Macintosh Plus and Saint Pepsi.\n\n3. **Klezmer**: This genre is traditional Ashkenazi Jewish folk music that originated in Eastern Europe. Klezmer bands typically use instruments like the clarinet, violin, and accordion. Klezmer saw a revival in the 70s and 80s with artists like the Klezmatics bringing new energy to the traditional sound.\n\n### Finding Albums or Singles for the Artist:\nNow, I will use the available tools to find albums or singles with the artist MBID b10bbbfc-cf9e-42e0-be17-e2c3e1d2600d.\n\nLet's proceed with that.",
