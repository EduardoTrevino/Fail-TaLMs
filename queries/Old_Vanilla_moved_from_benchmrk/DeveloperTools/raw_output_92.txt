      }
    ],
    "query": "I have a website URL that I want to shorten for sharing purposes. Also, I want to predict the nationality of the name 'Carlos'. Can you help me with both?",
    "relevant APIs": [],
    "query_id": 1
  }
]
```

**Explanation**:

- The first `api_list` entry refers to `shorten_url`, which can be utilized to shorten a URL, a common task when needing to share links easily.
- The second entry is for `predict_nationality`, which predicts the nationality based on a given name, useful for identifying the likely country of origin of a name such as "Carlos".
