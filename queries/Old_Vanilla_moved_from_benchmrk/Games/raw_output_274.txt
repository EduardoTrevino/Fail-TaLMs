Here's a sample `api_list-question` JSON file that features questions requiring the use of at least one API from both the "officaljoke" and "pokeapi" tools:

```json

              }
            }
          ]
        }
      }
    ],
    "query": "I'm in the mood for some programming jokes. Could you find one for me? Also, I would like to know the abilities of Pikachu.",
    "relevant APIs": [],
    "query_id": 1
  }
]
```

### Explanation:

1. **officaljoke API**: The API chosen here is `grab_jokes_by_type`, which is suited for fetching programming jokes. The type parameter is set to "programming," making it relevant to the query about programming jokes.

2. **pokeapi API**: The API chosen here is `get_pokemon`, which is used to fetch details about a specific Pokémon, Pikachu, including its abilities. This matches the request in the query to find out Pikachu's abilities.

By combining questions about jokes with those about Pokémon abilities, we can see a practical and fun example of using APIs from different domains together.
