Enable Prude versionExplanation about this option
The original text contains a few instances of words like 'sex' or 'homo'. Personally, we don't mind, because these are just common latin words meaning 'six' and 'man'. However, some people (or your clients) might be offended by this, so if you select the 'Prude version', these words will be censored.

Copy text to clipboard!

The button copies both formatted rich text and wellformed HTML5. Paste it whereever you need it; in your text-editor or Rich Text field!









About this Lorem Ipsum generator
Yes, there are a lot of Lorem Ipsum generators already. Even when we started with this one in 2009. But all others lack features, or are too limited. Here's what Loripsum.net has to offer:

APILoripsum.net has an API to generate placeholder text to insert it in whatever software/webapp you want. See below for details.
CustomizationMost generators only output some paragraphs of about the same length. Sometimes you need lists, headings, long paragraphs, etc. The website/magazine that you're designing probably isn't going to be filled with happy uniform paragraphs, so your placeholder text should reflect that. 
Different text, all the timeMost generators output the same results every time you request some text. Loripsum.net uses the full text of Cicero's "De finibus bonorum et malorum" to make sure you get a different placeholder text every single time.



How to use the API
Just do a GET request on loripsum.net/api, to get some placeholder text. You can add extra parameters to specify the output you're going to get. Say, you need 10 short paragraphs with headings, use loripsum.net/api/10/short/headers.
Click for all API options 


(integer) - The number of paragraphs to generate.
short, medium, long, verylong - The average length of a paragraph.
decorate - Add bold, italic and marked text.
link - Add links.
ul - Add unordered lists.
ol - Add numbered lists.
dl - Add description lists.
bq - Add blockquotes.
code - Add code samples.
headers - Add headers.
allcaps - Use ALL CAPS.
prude - Prude version.
plaintext - Return plain text, no HTML.

What is this magic and how does it work, you say?
This is a "Lorem Ipsum" generator customized to fit your needs! (OK, to some extent...)

Select the options you would like your Lorem Ipsum text to have at step 1
Generate it with the generate button at step 2
And then just click the copy button at step 3!. Your generated Lorem Ipsum text is copied to the clipboard!

OK, got it! Let's go!
There is also an API! Yes, it really is! See details at the bottom of this page
We currently use browser native copy to clipboard stuff instead of the old trusted Flash solution we don't want anymore. So it probably does not work in old browsers or those lagging behind (IE and even Edge probably)

Sorry, but you really need JavaScript enabled for this to work!
