 Free Recipe API Support
The API and site will always remain free to access at its basic level.
If you love our service and want extra features you can sign up as a Patreon supporter for $3.
You can cancel anytime. This allows us to pay for the servers and bandwidth and develop new features and content.

 Test API Key
You can use the test API key "1" during development of your app or for educational use (see test links below)
However you must sign up to Patreon if you want a production API key if releasing publicly on an appstore.
All data is returned in JSON format. We recomend Json view chrome extension to view the data in your web browser.

 API Production Key Upgrade
All Patreon supporters have access to the beta version of the API which allows mutiple ingredient filters.
Supporters also get special lookups for Popular and Recent Cocktails. You can also list the full database rather than limited to 100 items.
You also get access to the latest and multi random image API methods.
Finally you also get access to adding your own cocktails and images.
Please sign up on Patreon and you will be sent a new key.
