                        What's Faker API?
                    





                Faker API it's a collection of completely free APIs that helps web developers and web designers generate fake data in a fast and easy way. No registration is required. No tokens, no authentication.
            

                Every resource allows to choose the API language by the "_locale" parameter and also allows to select the number of rows requested by the "_quantity" parameter. Max 1000 rows.
            

                Check the Docs to read more about every resource. In addition, it's available the Postman collection to use these APIs directly in the well-known client.
            

                At the end of this page you will find the Test section, where you can test our APIs throug the specific form.

Base URL #


https://fakerapi.it/api/v1/{resource}






Basic Usage #


                Some resources allow to filter data by GET parameters.
                The names of these parameters are always preceded by an underscore character "_", for example:
                https://fakerapi.it/api/v1/images?_width=380


                Data are always wrapped inside a "data" object and are always returned with the total number of rows ("total") and with the Http response "code".
            

                Every resource accepts 3 common GET parameters:
            

_locale
_quantity
_seed


            _locale #


                Default: en_US
            

                This parameter means the language of the API response we want to get and accept the locale format "en_EN". For example:
            
https://fakerapi.it/api/v1/persons?_locale=fr_FR

                This example returns people with french names.
            

            _quantity #


                Default: 10
            

                Min: 1 - Max: 1000
            

                This parameter means the number of rows we want to obtain and accept only integers. If you request more than 1000 rows (maximum) the system will return 1000 rows anyway. Example:
            
https://fakerapi.it/api/v1/companies?_quantity=5

                This example returns 5 companies.
            

            _seed #


                Default: null
            

                This parameter accept an integer and allows to get always the same results. So, executing the same request with _seed parameter set to the same value (ex. 12345) the results will never change. Example:
            
https://fakerapi.it/api/v1/companies?_seed=12456

                    This resource is the only one which does'nt follow the same rules of the others.
                    The 3 common parameters (_quantity, _locale, _seed) have the same usage of the other resources, but this request it's managed in a different way.
                

                    Request to this resource accepts custom parameters following this pattern:
                
myCustomName1=customType1&myCustomName2=customType2

                    where myCustomName1 and myCustomName2 are my custom parameters names, and customType1 and customType2 are my custom parameters types. See below the allowed types.
                

                    This allows to generate a custom ad hoc resource, using type parameters listed below:
