Because Ron Swanson is a hero. Just a ridiculously simple Node.js server.
Production host
https://ron-swanson-quotes.herokuapp.com/v2/quotes
The Access-Control-Allow-Origin header is set to * so that you can make requests from any domain.
APIs
GET /v2/quotes
Returns an array with one quote:
[
    "Capitalism: God’s way of determining who is smart and who is poor."
]
GET /v2/quotes/<count>
Returns an array with <count> quotes e.g. GET /quotes/2
[
    "Capitalism: God’s way of determining who is smart and who is poor.",
    "Clear alcohols are for rich women on diets."
]
GET /v2/quotes/search/<term>
Returns an array of quotes matching <term> without case sensitivity e.g. GET /quotes/search/hate
[
    "There's only one thing I hate more than lying: skim milk. Which is water that's lying about being milk.",
    "I hate everything."
]
OpenAPI 3 Schema
An OpenAPI 3 schema is available at /v2/schema. Thanks to Chris Gali for the suggestion and the initial draft.
JavaScript demo
JSFiddle (requires a browser with support for Promises, ES6, fetch, and generator functions.)
Hubot integration
I wrote a Hubot script that can be installed via npm. See the repo for more details.
Local development
Once you've cloned this repo, run npm i to install the dependencies.
Then you can run:

npm run build: builds the TypeScript source code
npm start: runs the compiled server
