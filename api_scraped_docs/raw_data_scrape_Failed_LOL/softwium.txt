Whether crafting prototypes or conducting rigorous tests, having well-structured dummy data facilitates the creation of applications.JSON data stands as a valuable resource for mimicking various scenarios. This versatile tool enables the creation of realistic prototypes and the testing of API endpoints, allowing developers to anticipate and address potential data manipulation issues.These APIs also allow you to obtain JSON data examples. This can always be useful and save time when you only need JSON data for certain tests.Test API endpointsSoftwium offer a collection of free public APIs (that I will try to complete over time).Testing API endpoints is an important step in the development process, ensuring that the data retrieved from these APIs aligns seamlessly with the requirements.Our free APIs provide access to realistic data, as as possible, allowing developers to validate their integration to avoid unpleasant surprises in production. Poor test data can more easily lead to bugs… it's up to you to see if our data meets your needs.Fake json dataThe fake APIs featured on this page return data from various repositories on GitHub, each carrying distinct licenses such as Apache, MIT, and others. These repositories serve as valuable resources for those seeking diverse datasets for testing and experimentation.https://github.com/joseluisq/json-datasetshttps://github.com/BrunnerLivio/deprecated-pokemongo-json-pokedexhttps://github.com/ozlerhakan/mongodb-json-fileshttps://github.com/dominictarr/random-name    Suggested Reads   Grok:  Elon Musk’s AI Already Has a Beta Version of Its API The new artificial intelligence interface of Grok already has its API!
