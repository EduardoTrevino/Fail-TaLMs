Thanks to our sponsor bunny.net it is lightning fast worldwide. You can use our official instance or run your own. Yes, the API is also OpenSource!Usage ​Use the following address and replace <styleName> with your preferred avatar style (camelCase). Every official avatar style is supported.https://api.dicebear.com/9.x/<styleName>/svgA few examples ​https://api.dicebear.com/9.x/pixel-art/svghttps://api.dicebear.com/9.x/lorelei/svgINFOWe provide a large number of avatar styles from different artists. The avatar styles are licensed under different licenses that the artists can choose themselves. For a quick overview we have created an license overview for you.Options ​Options can be passed via the query string. For example, you can set a seed like this:https://api.dicebear.com/9.x/pixel-art/svg?seed=Johnhttps://api.dicebear.com/9.x/pixel-art/svg?seed=JaneTIPIf you want to pass more options, you connect them with a & as usual with query strings.Array options ​Array values are separated by a comma. For example, the URL could look like this if you want to provide the PRNG with several hair styles in addition to the seed. Note that the avatar styles provide different options. In this example, we use the Pixel Art avatar style.https://api.dicebear.com/9.x/pixel-art/svg?seed=John&hair=short01,short02,short03,short04,short05https://api.dicebear.com/9.x/pixel-art/svg?seed=Jane&hair=long01,long02,long03,long04,long05Boolean options ​Boolean values can be set as strings (true and false).https://api.dicebear.com/9.x/lorelei/svg?flip=truehttps://api.dicebear.com/9.x/lorelei/svg?flip=falseFile format ​The API supports SVG, PNG, JPG, WebP, AVIF and JSON. We recommend using SVG if possible! SVG is the more modern format, scales indefinitely, and requires less traffic. Because the PNG, JPG, WebP and AVIF formats put more load on the API, the size is limited to 256x256. PNG, JPG, WebP and AVIF also have a lower rate limit.PNG, JPG, WebP and AVIF use the Noto Sans font and currently supports the following subsets: cyrillic, cyrillic-ext, devanagari, greek, greek-ext, japanese, korean, latin, latin-ext, simplified-chinese, thai and vietnamese.https://api.dicebear.com/9.x/bottts/svghttps://api.dicebear.com/9.x/bottts/pnghttps://api.dicebear.com/9.x/bottts/jpghttps://api.dicebear.com/9.x/bottts/webphttps://api.dicebear.com/9.x/bottts/avifVersioning ​You can set the version in the URL. Just replace the 9.x from the previous examples with the one you want.Supported versions: 5.x, 6.x, 7.x, 8.x, 9.xWARNINGWe reserve the right to discontinue any version at any time without notice. You can create your own instance of the API to be able to access discontinued versions even afterwards.Fair use ​Our API is free to use, but we ask that you use it responsibly. We reserve the right to block abusive users. Currently, we limit the number of requests. See Rate limits for more information. We also ask you to use the API only for non-commercial purposes. If you want to use the API for commercial purposes or need more requests per second, please set up your own instance.We are happy to answer any questions you may have. Just open an discussion on GitHub.Rate limits ​We currently limit the number of requests per second to 50 for SVG and to 10 for PNG, JPG, WebP and AVIF. We reserve the right to change these limits at any time without notice.Changes and Availability ​Please be aware that we reserve the right to update the API at any time. While we will do our best to maintain backwards compatibility, we cannot guarantee this. Even though we try to always return the same avatar, the design and especially the source code may change. Additionally, we cannot guarantee that the API will always be available. If you need consistent access to the API, we recommend setting up your own instance.
