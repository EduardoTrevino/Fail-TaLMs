I started to use isEven with the free tier about a year ago and never stopped since then. It does all the work to figure out if a number is even and allows me to focus on core development activities like new product research and design. I love it and recommend it to everyone.
Jude Thorn - Python Developer
 
 





 

Awesome features for the money. I never thought such a low amount of money would bring me so many answers per month. Before isEven I used a giant case expression and it was a mess. Highly recommended to programmers focused on results.
Roy Smith - Ruby Developer
 
 





 

I usually hate using APIs and trying new things. I prefer to keep all dependencies to a minimum. But when my friend on IRC mentioned isEven API, I just had to test it out. And I'm glad I did!
Dusty Anderson - Perl Developer
 
 





 

isEven is the best numerical API for small and medium sized business. It understands the mindset of young programmers and provides the necessary data for wise number-related decisions. Just give it a try and you will definitely not regret spending your time.
Eddie Singer - Javascript Developer
 
 





 

isEven is one of the greatest APIs out there. I especially love the number API route because it gives me such a great amount of information based on a little amount of input gathered in just few weeks of light weight usage. Recommended!
