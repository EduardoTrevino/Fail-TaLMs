IP Location - Geolocation
IP Geolocation and reverse IP geocoding technology on the web are about detecting requests coming from your visitors and locating them in the world, down to the city they are in, based on their IP address.

geoPlugin is the easiest way for you to geolocate your visitors, allowing you to provide geolocalised content more relevant to their geographical location. Simple examples are redirecting visitors to language-specific pages, providing your product prices in your visitor's local currency, knowing whether European GDPR privacy rules apply, and much more.

We have been providing stable, reliable, fast and free IP geolocation coming from many millions of visitors for our many thousands of clients worldwide since 2006 (and our website hasn't changed in design since!).

API access
geoPlugin provides a free geolocation API in multiple different programming languages in a single API call. There is no software installation required, no API key and whether your programming language of choice be Javascript, PHP, XML, JSON, ASP, or CSV, geoPlugin has a way to simply and efficiently geo-localize your visitors.

Each simple call to the API will also provide an accurate and up-to-date geolocalized currency converter so you know how much your product costs in your visitor's currency

IP Geolocation can be performed on both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses using the same API request format. geoPlugin detects whether the IP is IPv4 or IPv6 automatically so you don't have to.

Check out the main IP geolocation WebServices section or the additional reverse geocoding extras for more information

Some ideas of how to use geoPlugin web services
Below are just a few examples1) using geoPlugin's geolocation webservice, with detailed code for reproduction of how you can use the values returned from geoPlugin.
For sure, the things you can do with these geolocalized data are pretty much limitless, but here are just a few examples to give you some ideas.

If you have other examples, submit them to us and once verified, we will post them here (of course with credits).
Example 1: Simple Hello World
<html>
 <head>
  <script language="JavaScript" src="http://www.geoplugin.net/javascript.gp" type="text/javascript"></script>
 </head>
 <body>
  <script language="Javascript"> 
	document.write("Welcome to our visitors from "+geoplugin_city()+", "+geoplugin_countryName()); 
  </script>
 </body>
</html>

Welcome to our visitors from Pittsburgh, United States




Example 2: Buying a television
<?php
$geoPlugin_array = unserialize( file_get_contents('http://www.geoplugin.net/php.gp?ip=' . $_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR']) );
 
if ( $geoPlugin_array['geoplugin_currencyCode'] == 'USD' ) { //let's use a different base currency
 
	$geoPlugin_array = unserialize( file_get_contents('http://www.geoplugin.net/php.gp?ip=' . $_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR'] . '&base_currency=EUR') );
 
	echo '<h3>A &#8364;800 television from Germany will cost you '.$geoPlugin_array['geoplugin_currencySymbol'] . round( (800 * $geoPlugin_array['geoplugin_currencyConverter']),0) . '</h3>';
 
} else {
 
	echo '<h3>A $800 television from the US will cost you ' . $geoPlugin_array['geoplugin_currencySymbol'] . round( (800 * $geoPlugin_array['geoplugin_currencyConverter']),0) . '</h3>';
 
}
?>

A €800 television from Germany will cost you $884


Example 3: Your own personalized weather forecast
Using the webservice from the Weather Underground, we can easily provide a personalized geolocated weather forecast for our visitors.

This code requires the ParseXml class.
<?php
 
$geoplugin = unserialize( file_get_contents('http://www.geoplugin.net/php.gp?ip=' . $_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR']) );
 
if ( is_numeric($geoplugin['geoplugin_latitude']) && is_numeric($geoplugin['geoplugin_longitude']) ) {
 
	$lat = $geoplugin['geoplugin_latitude'];
	$long = $geoplugin['geoplugin_longitude'];
	//set farenheight for US
	if ($geoplugin['geoplugin_countryCode'] == 'US') {
		$tempScale = 'fahrenheit';
		$tempUnit = '&deg;F';
	} else {
		$tempScale = 'celsius';
		$tempUnit = '&deg;C';
	}
	require_once('ParseXml.class.php');
 
	$xml = new ParseXml(); 
	$xml->LoadRemote("http://api.wunderground.com/auto/wui/geo/ForecastXML/index.xml?query={$lat},{$long}", 3);
	$dataArray = $xml->ToArray();
 
	$html = "<center><h2>Weather forecast for " . $geoplugin['geoplugin_city'];
	$html .= "</h2><table cellpadding=5 cellspacing=10><tr>";
 
	foreach ($dataArray['simpleforecast']['forecastday'] as $arr) {
 
		$html .= "<td align='center'>" . $arr['date']['weekday'] . "<br />";
		$html .= "<img src='http://icons-pe.wxug.com/i/c/a/" . $arr['icon'] . ".gif' border=0 /><br />";
		$html .= "<font color='red'>" . $arr['high'][$tempScale] . $tempUnit . " </font>";
		$html .= "<font color='blue'>" . $arr['low'][$tempScale] . $tempUnit . "</font>";
		$html .= "</td>";
 
 
	}
	$html .= "</tr></table>";
 
	echo $html;
}
 
?>

will output your own weather forecast.
Weather forecast for Pittsburgh


Example 4: Embedding a Google Map
This is a geolocation example to embed a map. The example uses Google maps and as such requires your own free Google maps API key
<html>
 <head>
  <script src="http://maps.google.com/maps?file=api&v=2&key=Your_Google_Maps_API_Key" type="text/javascript"></script>
  <script language="JavaScript" src="http://www.geoplugin.net/javascript.gp" type="text/javascript"></script>
 
  <script type="text/javascript">
    function load() {
      if (GBrowserIsCompatible()) {
        var map = new GMap2(document.getElementById("map"));
        map.addControl(new GLargeMapControl());
        map.addControl(new GMapTypeControl());
        map.setCenter(new GLatLng(geoplugin_latitude(), geoplugin_longitude()), 12);
      }
    }
  </script>
 </head>
 <body>
   <div id="map" style="width: 500px; height: 300px"></div>
   <script>load();</script>
 </body>
</html>



Example 5: An AJAX Currency Converter
Normally, AJAX can't be used to perform cross-site requests, but using jQuery's JSON request, we can sidestep this annoyance.
This example, while not geolocation, stemmed from the currency converter that is included in the geolocation webservice.
The following currency converter example uses Google's Javascript API as the source for jQuery, and geoPlugin for the currency converter javascript. Of course, you may substitute these for your own versions.

 
<script src="http://www.geoplugin.net/javascript.gp" type="text/javascript"></script>
<!-- when using Google to load JSON API -->
<script src="http://www.google.com/jsapi" type="text/javascript"></script>
<script src="http://www.geoplugin.net/ajax_currency_converter.gp" type="text/javascript"></script>
<!-- When using your own JSON API -->
<!-- <script src="http://www.geoplugin.net/ajax_currency_converter.gp?nogoog=1" type="text/javascript">
</script> -->
<input type='text' id='gp_amount' size='4' /> 
<select id="gp_from"></select> to <select id="gp_to"></select>
<p><input type='button' onClick='gp_convertIt()' value = 'Convert It' /></p>
<div id="gp_converted"></div>
<script>gp_currencySymbols()</script>

That's all that is needed to embed an AJAX real-time currency converter like below on your pages!
