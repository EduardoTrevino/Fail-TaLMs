Itâ€™s all in the details






Hosted on
                            Heroku


                        Which means 99.99% Uptime SLA.All you need is the
                        base URL, and you're away: https://reqres.in/api/The API is CORS enabled, so you can make
                        requests right from the browser, no matter what domain,
                        or even from somewhere like JSFiddle or JSBin.
                    



Language agnostic

                        A generic API that conforms to REST principles and
                        accepts a content type of application/jsonAny endpoint that contains
                        "<resource>" can be substituted with anything you
                        supply, ie. "products", "accounts", etc..the API will
                        just respond with various Pantone colours.
                    



Getting started




Check out the Swagger doc:





jQuery
If you, for example, want to create a fake user:

$.ajax({
    url: "https://reqres.in/api/users",
    type: "POST",
    data: {
        name: "paul rudd",
        movies: ["I Love You Man", "Role Models"]
    },
    success: function(response){
        console.log(response);
    }
});
				
For which the response to this request will be...

{
    "name":"paul rudd",
    "movies[]":[
        "I Love You Man",
        "Role Models"
    ],
    "id":"243",
    "createdAt":"2014-10-18T12:09:05.255Z"
}
				

                    You can see that the API has sent us back whatever user
                    details we sent it, plus an
                    id &
                    createdAt key for our use.
                



Native JavaScript

                    If you've already got your own application entities, ie.
                    "products", you can send them in the endpoint URL, like so:
                

var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
xhr.open("GET", "https://reqres.in/api/products/3", true);
xhr.onload = function(){
    console.log(xhr.responseText);
};
xhr.send();
				

                    It would be impossible for Reqres to know your application
                    data, so the API will respond from a sample set of Pantone
                    colour data
                

{
    "data":{
        "id":3,
        "name":"true red",
        "year":2002,
        "pantone_value":"19-1664"
    }
}
				

                    It's entirely possible to get sample data into your
                    interface in seconds!
                


Still don't really get it...






Reqres is a real API


                        Reqres simulates real application scenarios. If you want
                        to test a user authentication system, Reqres will
                        respond to a successful login/register request with a
                        token for you to identify a sample user, or with a 403
                        forbidden response to an unsuccessful login/registration
                        attempt. A common front-end scenario that's
                        easily forgotten is loading states, which can be easily
                        simulated through Reqres by appending ?delay=<a number of seconds>
                        to any endpoint URL, which will delay the API response
                        time. Animated loading GIFs & SVGs at the ready!
                    



Technical demos and tutorials

                        If you're trying to demonstrate a front-end
                        (JavaScript-based) concept, you don't really want the
                        hassle of setting up an API, or even a server
                        (especially during a live workshop or demo).
                        You can just write your HTML, CSS & JavaScript as
                        usual and send Reqres AJAX requests, which will respond
                        with the expected response codes and output.
                    



Rapid prototyping of interfaces

                        When prototyping a new interface, you just want an API
                        there, with minimal setup effort involved.
                        Normally, I'd point people, who aren't too familiar with
                        backend programming, to
                        Sailsjs which can
                        auto-generate a REST-API for you from the command
                        line.
                        However, you will need Node.js installed and some
                        familiarity of how Node.js works. If that sounds like
                        too much hassle and way too daunting, Reqres is just a
                        URL. Sending it an AJAX request is step 1...there is no
                        step 2.
                    



Peace of mind




                It might seem pretty weird to be sending your
                data to a 3rd party API, but I can assure you, Reqres
                does not store any of your data at all. Once
                you send it to us, we just send it straight back...and then it's
                gone!
