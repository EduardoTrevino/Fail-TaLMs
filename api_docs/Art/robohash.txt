Here are five Robots, Randomly generated, Just for you!
    
By appending ?set=set2 to our Image's URLs, we are able to generate a whole slew of Random monsters. Here are 5 we picked out for you.

    
By appending ?set=set3 to our URLs, we get back to robots. New, suave, disembodied heads. That's sexy. Like a robot.

    
By appending ?set=set4 to our URLs, we can hydroponically grow beautiful kittens.

    
Robohashes are awesome.

Supported FormatsStyles of Robot
Want a JPG instead? Fine. PNG? Fine. Want it as a bitmap? I think you're nutty. But fine. Just change the URL to request in any format you want. If you want it to hash the whole thing, including the extension use ?ignoreext=false to hash the extensions.

Very infrequent murderous rampages.Very Infrequent Rampages
Due to Robot caching modules and CDN usage, our robots stay speedy, and only rarely go on murderous rampages. That's a Fact!

3 classes to choose fromBuilt in multiple sizes
From destroying skyscrapers to nonobots, we've got you covered. Try appending ?size=200x200

Robots on VacationRobots at your Location
Our robots like to travel. If you append ?bgset=bg1 (or bg2 or any) to your URL, our robots will add a background as part of the hash.

Robotic ValuesRobotic Value
Robohash.org robots believe in Family, Warmth, and killing-all-humans. To that end, we provide this service for free.

Everyone needs Robots!
RoboHash.org is here because Robots are funny, and because I needed the algorithm/art anyway for a Super-Awesome new forum I'm working on. If you use a specific set, or a list of them, like "?sets=1,3" , it'll probably stay the same as it is now. If you use "set=any", it'll include any new sets I happen to add, so existing hashes may change.

You should email me - robo@robohash.org

If the bandwidth gets crazy, I might add a [Robohash.org] banner to the bottom of the image. But it'd be super-tasteful.
Advanced classes in Robotry.
For those inclined, there are several advanced techniques which have been added over time.

For Gravatar enthusiasts, you can ask Robohash to use a Gravatar if one is available.
Put either the email, or the hashed version, in your image where the string normally goes -

For example: https://robohash.org/robo@robohash.org?gravatar=yes
or https://robohash.org/620050a4db5104bae758cd75171d64ca?gravatar=hashed

We've also conditioned our robots to accept commands either via params or directories-
For instance https://robohash.org/set_set3/bgset_bg1/3.14159?size=500x500

Finally, the Blueprints are available to build your own robotic factory.

By the way - For those afraid of the robocalypse, you can also generate humans technicians to mind the robot army, by appending ?set=set5 to our URLs.
