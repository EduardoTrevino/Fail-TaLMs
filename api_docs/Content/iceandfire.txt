Open source
The API is open source! Contribute directly to the API by writing code, documentation or posting bugs!

Documentation
All data is accessible through our HTTP API with SDKs in a bunch of different languages. Check out the documentation to get started.

Introduction
Joakim Skoog edited this page on Jan 23 · 1 revision
This documentation will help you familiarise yourself with the API and how to consume the different resources that are available. The documentation provides all information needed to get started and it also has educational examples for all resources.

If you're interested in using a native implementation, please take a look at the Libraries

Authentication
Joakim Skoog edited this page on Jan 23 · 1 revision
An API of Ice And Fire is an open API. This means that no authentication is required to query the API for data. Since no authentication is required, there is only support for GET requests.

Pagination
Joakim Skoog edited this page on Jan 23 · 1 revision
An API of Ice And Fire provides a lot of data about the world of Westeros. To prevent our servers from getting cranky, the API will automatically paginate the responses. You will learn how to create requests with pagination parameters and consume the response.

Things worth noting:
Information about the pagination is included in the Link header
Page numbering is 1-based
You can specify how many items you want to receive per page, the maximum is 50
Request
You specify which page you want to access with the ?page parameter, if you don't provide the ?page parameter the first page will be returned. You can also specify the size of the page with the ?pageSize parameter, if you don't provide the ?pageSize parameter the default size of 10 will be used.

Let's make a request for the first page of characters with a page size of 10. Since we're only interested in the pagination information we provide the -I parameter to say that we only care about the headers.

$ curl -I "https://www.anapioficeandfire.com/api/characters?page=1&pageSize=10"
Response

Link: <https://www.anapioficeandfire.com/api/characters?page=2&pageSize=10>; rel="next", <https://www.anapioficeandfire.com/api/characters?page=1&pageSize=10>; rel="first", <https://www.anapioficeandfire.com/api/characters?page=214&pageSize=10>; rel="last"
Possible link types
next - Next page of results
prev - Previous page of results
first - First page of results
last - Last page of results
These links can then be used to navigate to other pages of results.
