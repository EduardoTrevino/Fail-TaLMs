Here is a `api_list-question` JSON example that fulfills the requirements of using at least one API from both the "jikan" and "therosary" tools:

```json
[
  {
    "api_list": [
      {
        "category_name": "Entertainment",
        "tool_name": "Jikan",

        "api_description": "Get anime resource by ID.",
        "required_parameters": [
          {

            "type": "INTEGER",
            "description": "The ID of the anime.",
            "default": "1"
          }
        ],
        "optional_parameters": [],
        "method": "GET",
        "template_response": {

            "episodes": "int"
          }
        }
      },
      {
        "category_name": "Spirituality",
        "tool_name": "therosary",

        "optional_parameters": [],
        "method": "GET",
        "template_response": {
          "prayers": [
            {
              "title": "str",
              "content": "str"
            }
          ]
        }
      }
    ],
    "query": "Could you tell me more about the anime with ID 1, including its synopsis and the number of episodes? Also, what is today's rosary prayer?",
    "relevant APIs": [],
    "query_id": 1
  }
]
```

#### Explanation:
- This JSON object includes a query that requires information from two distinct sources.
- It uses the `get_anime_by_id` API from the "Jikan" tool to retrieve details about a specific anime, including its synopsis and number of episodes, which aligns with a request about anime information.
- It also uses the `get_today_prayer` API from the "therosary" tool to fetch today's rosary prayer, catering to a spirituality-related query.
- Both APIs are independent but are included together in the query to form a comprehensive information request involving both categories (anime and spirituality).
