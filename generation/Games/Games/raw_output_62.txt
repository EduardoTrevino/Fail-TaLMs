To create a `api_list-question` JSON file using the provided APIs from the "boardgamesgeek" and "officaljoke" tools, here is how it can be structured. Below are questions that utilize at least one API from each tool:

```json
[
  {
    "api_list": [
      {
        "category_name": "Games",
        "tool_name": "boardgamesgeek",
        "api_name": "get_thing_items",
        "api_description": "Retrieve information about specific 'thing' items.",
        "required_parameters": [
          {
            "name": "ids",
            "type": "STRING",
            "description": "IDs of the things to retrieve."
          }
        ],
        "optional_parameters": [
          {
            "name": "type",
            "type": "STRING",
            "description": "Filter by specific thing types."
          }
        ],
        "method": "GET"
      },
      {
        "category_name": "Jokes",
        "tool_name": "officaljoke",
        "api_name": "grab_random_joke",
        "api_description": "Grab a random joke.",
        "required_parameters": [],
        "optional_parameters": [],
        "method": "GET"
      }
    ],
    "query": "Can you tell me about the board game with ID 174430 and also share a random joke to lighten the mood?",
    "relevant APIs": [],
    "query_id": 1
  },
  {
    "api_list": [
      {
        "category_name": "Games",
        "tool_name": "boardgamesgeek",
        "api_name": "search_items",
        "api_description": "Search for items by name from the BGG database.",
        "required_parameters": [
          {
            "name": "query",
            "type": "STRING",
            "description": "Search query."
          }
        ],
        "optional_parameters": [
          {
            "name": "type",
            "type": "STRING",
            "description": "The type of items to return."
          }
        ],
        "method": "GET"
      },
      {
        "category_name": "Jokes",
        "tool_name": "officaljoke",
        "api_name": "grab_ten_random_jokes",
        "api_description": "Grab ten random jokes.",
        "required_parameters": [],
        "optional_parameters": [],
        "method": "GET"
      }
    ],
    "query": "Please search for board games related to 'Catan'. Also, fetch me ten random jokes to entertain a group of friends.",
    "relevant APIs": [],
    "query_id": 2
  }
]
```

### Notes:
1. **Query Construction**: Each question is designed to be independent and requires the use of at least one API from both tools.
2. **API Selection and Parameters**: The APIs selected in each set are chosen to offer a comprehensive result for the query. Required and optional parameters are described to help understand the API capabilities.
3. **Integration Potential**: While the APIs operate independently, the question suggests a user scenario where information from both sources (games and jokes) might be useful together, such as in an entertainment or recreational context.

This JSON structure is designed to help determine which APIs can be jointly invoked to fulfill the given query, making it easier to determine integration points between different services in hypothetical applications.
