Here's a sample `api_list-question` JSON file with questions that require using at least one API from each of the two tools: "runescape" and "tcgdex".

```json

    "api_list": [
        {
            "tool_name": "runescape",

                    "description": "The skill or activity table."
                },

                    "name": "category",
                    "type": "INTEGER",
                    "description": "The category for the skill or activity."
                }
            ],
            "optional_parameters": [

                    "type": "INTEGER",
                    "description": "The amount of players to return, max 50.",
                    "default": 50
                }
            ]
        },
        {
            "tool_name": "tcgdex",
            "api_name": "list_rarities",
            "api_description": "List different card rarities.",
            "required_parameters": [],
            "optional_parameters": []
        }
    ],
    "query": "What are the top 10 players in RuneScape for the skill table 9, category 0, and can you list all card rarities available in the TCGdex database?",
    "relevant APIs": [],
    "query_id": 2
  }
]
```

In this JSON:

- The first query combines the use of `grand_exchange_detail` from the RuneScape API to get detailed information about a RuneScape item, and `get_card` from the tcgdex API to get details about a specific TCG card.
- The second query requests player rankings from `hiscores_ranking` in RuneScape and lists card rarities using `list_rarities` from the tcgdex API. 

These questions are independent and require separate API calls according to the purpose of each tool.
