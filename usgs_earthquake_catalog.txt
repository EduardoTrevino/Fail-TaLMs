API Documentation - Earthquake Catalog



  This is an implementation of the
  
      FDSN Event Web Service Specification,
  and allows custom searches for earthquake information using a variety of
  parameters.

Please note that automated applications should use
  
      Real-time GeoJSON Feeds
  for displaying earthquake information whenever possible, as they will have
  the best performance and availability for that type of information.

Query method Parameters

  These parameters should be submitted as key=value pairs using the HTTP GET
  method and may not be specified more than once; if a parameter is submitted
  multiple times the result is undefined.

            NOTE: Only works when specifying eventid
            parameter.
