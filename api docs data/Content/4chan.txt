Welcome to the documentation for 4chan's read-only JSON API, originally launched in September of 2012.
Getting started
Data from the 4chan API is exclusively accessible from a.4cdn.org, via either http:// or https:// protocols. a.4cdn.org serves JSON representations of posts made at 4chan.org and 4channel.org boards. All examples in the documentation for the 4chan API use https://.

CORS is supported from origins boards.4chan.org or boards.4channel.org, via http:// or https://. Requests are accepted when using the following HTTP request types:
