					   Data Source Open-Meteo weather forecast APIs use weather models from multiple national weather providers.
		For each location worldwide, the best models will be combined to provide the best possible
		forecast. Weather models cover different geographic areas at different resolutions and provide different
		weather variables. Depending on the model, data have been interpolated to hourly values or not
		all weather variables are available. With the drop down Weather models (just below the
		hourly variables), you can select and compare individual weather models.

		variables and responds with a JSON hourly weather forecast for 7 days. Time always starts at
		0:00 today and contains 168 hours. If
		&forecast_days=16 is set, up to 16 days of forecast can be returned. All URL parameters
		are listed below: Parameter Format Required Default Description latitude, longitude Floating point Yes  Geographical WGS84 coordinates of the location. Multiple coordinates can be comma
						separated. E.g. &latitude=52.52,48.85&longitude=13.41,2.35. To return data
						for multiple locations the JSON output changes to a list of structures. CSV and XLSX
						formats add a column location_id. elevation Floating point No  The elevation used for statistical downscaling. Per default, a 90 meter digital elevation model is used. You can manually set the elevation to correctly match mountain peaks. If
						&elevation=nan is specified, downscaling will be disabled and the API uses the
						average grid-cell height. For multiple locations, elevation can also be comma separated. hourly String array No  A list of weather variables which should be returned. Values can be comma separated, or
						multiple
						&hourly= parameter in the URL can be used. daily String array No  A list of daily weather variable aggregations which should be returned. Values can be
						comma separated, or multiple &daily= parameter in the URL can be used. If
						daily weather variables are specified, parameter timezone is required. current String array No  A list of weather variables to get current conditions. temperature_unit String No celsius If fahrenheit is set, all temperature values are converted to Fahrenheit. wind_speed_unit String No kmh Other wind speed speed units: ms, mph and kn precipitation_unit String No mm Other precipitation amount units: inch timeformat String No iso8601 If format unixtime is selected, all time values are returned in UNIX epoch
						time in seconds. Please note that all timestamp are in GMT+0! For daily values with unix
						timestamps, please apply
						utc_offset_seconds again to get the correct date. timezone String No GMT If timezone is set, all timestamps are returned as local-time and data is
						returned starting at 00:00 local-time. Any time zone name from the
						time zone database
						is supported. If auto is set as a time zone, the coordinates will be automatically
						resolved to the local time zone. For multiple coordinates, a comma separated list of timezones
						can be specified. past_days Integer (0-92) No 0 If past_days is set, yesterday or the day before yesterday data are also returned. forecast_days Integer (0-16) No 7 Per default, only 7 days are returned. Up to 16 days of forecast are possible. forecast_hoursforecast_minutely_15past_hourspast_minutely_15 Integer (>0) No  Similar to forecast_days, the number of timesteps of hourly and 15-minutely data can controlled. Instead of using the current day as a reference, the current hour or the current 15-minute time-step is used. start_dateend_date String (yyyy-mm-dd) No  The time interval to get weather data. A day must be specified as an ISO8601 date (e.g.
						2022-06-30). start_hourend_hourstart_minutely_15end_minutely_15 String (yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm) No  The time interval to get weather data for hourly or 15 minutely data. Time must be specified as an ISO8601 date (e.g.
						2022-06-30T12:00). models String array No auto Manually select one or more weather models. Per default, the best suitable weather
						models will be combined. cell_selection String No land Set a preference how grid-cells are selected. The default land finds a
						suitable grid-cell on land with
						similar elevation to the requested coordinates using a 90-meter digital elevation
							model.
						sea prefers grid-cells on sea. nearest selects the nearest possible
						grid-cell. apikey String No  Only required to commercial use to access reserved API resources for customers. The
						server URL requires the prefix customer-. See
						pricing for more information. Additional optional URL parameters will be added. For API stability, no required parameters will
		be added in the future! Hourly Parameter Definition The parameter &hourly= accepts the following values. Most weather variables are given
		as an instantaneous value for the indicated hour. Some variables like precipitation are calculated
		from the preceding hour as an average or sum. Variable Valid time Unit Description temperature_2m Instant °C (°F) Air temperature at 2 meters above ground relative_humidity_2m Instant % Relative humidity at 2 meters above ground dew_point_2m Instant °C (°F) Dew point temperature at 2 meters above ground apparent_temperature Instant °C (°F) Apparent temperature is the perceived feels-like temperature combining wind chill
						factor, relative humidity and solar radiation pressure_mslsurface_pressure Instant hPa Atmospheric air pressure reduced to mean sea level (msl) or pressure at surface.

						standard level. wind_direction_10mwind_direction_80mwind_direction_120mwind_direction_180m Instant ° Wind direction at 10, 80, 120 or 180 meters above ground wind_gusts_10m Preceding hour max km/h (mph, m/s, knots) Gusts at 10 meters above ground as a maximum of the preceding hour shortwave_radiation Preceding hour mean W/m² Shortwave solar radiation as average of the preceding hour. This is equal to the total
						global horizontal irradiation direct_radiationdirect_normal_irradiance Preceding hour mean W/m² Direct solar radiation as average of the preceding hour on the horizontal plane and the
						normal plane (perpendicular to the sun) diffuse_radiation Preceding hour mean W/m² Diffuse solar radiation as average of the preceding hour global_tilted_irradiance Preceding hour mean W/m² Total radiation received on a tilted pane as average of the preceding hour. 
						The calculation is assuming a fixed albedo of 20% and in isotropic sky. 
						Please specify tilt and azimuth parameter. Tilt ranges from 0° to 90° and is typically around 45°. 
						Azimuth should be close to 0° (0° south, -90° east, 90° west).

		on NOAA HRRR model for North America and DWD ICON-D2 and Météo-France AROME model for Central Europe. If 15-minutely data is requested
		for other regions data is interpolated from 1-hourly to 15-minutely. 15-minutely data can be requested for other weather variables that are available for hourly
		data, but will use interpolation.
