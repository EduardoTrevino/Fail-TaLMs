TRITON is a media pipeline that aims to go one step further than services like Jellyfin and Plex provide. Media is fetched from a magnitude of supported protocols (HTTP, S3-compatible, Usenet, etc), converted into multiple different quality levels, and then uploaded to a S3-compatible storage provider in an organized fashion. This enables cheap storage and ensures that buffering is never a problem. On top of all of this, a frontend allows users to watch your media on the go.
