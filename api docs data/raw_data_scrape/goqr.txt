QR code API: Documentation




						Using our API, you can create and read QR code graphics yourself. The documents listed here are mainly targeted at application/web developers – but don’t let that scare you away in case you’re new to the subject. We’re pretty sure that using the API is rather straightforward, even for beginners.
