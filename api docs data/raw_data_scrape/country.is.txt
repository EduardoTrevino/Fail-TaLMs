IP Geolocation API | Country.is







Country.is

Country is an open-source geolocation API that finds a user's country
(and nothing else) from their IP address. It works both with IPv4 and IPv6.


The public instance we run at api.country.is is
free to use. It does not require an API key or impose usage quotas.














Usage
Country has a minimal ðŸ”¥ interface.
Have your browser or app query its own IP address.






https://api.country.is



Query an abitrary IP.






https://api.country.is/9.9.9.9



See the data sources.

Country automatically checks for new MaxMind data every 24 hours.
Deployment

If you prefer not to use the hosted service, run your own private server
with Docker.

Notes

Country uses geolocation data provided by
Cloudfare
and MaxMind.


Since 30 December 2019, you need to
register for a license key
to download the MaxMind data if you're running a private instance.


Our public instance does not log requests.
