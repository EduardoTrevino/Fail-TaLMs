              Get favicons from any domain using a hidden google API

Did you know ?
Google offers a secret URL that can automatically pull the favicon image of any domain. Cherries on the cake, we can ask for different sizes and the images returned are in PNG format (not ICO), meaning they will render correctly in all browsers using the <img> tag.
The API works using a simple GET:


https://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain=${domain}&sz=${size}



Enter fullscreen mode


Exit fullscreen mode





The query parameters are:


domain: mandatory, the domain you are interested in,

sz: optional, a size hint such as 256.

In case the right size is not found, it will return the default one, usually 16x16.

https://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain=dev.to&sz=128
 
https://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain=dev.to&sz=512 (nothing found for 512x512, so returns a 16x16 PNG)

https://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain=stackoverflow.com&sz=128 (yep, sometimes the quality is far from optimal)

Nice writeup! Privacy-friendly search engine DuckDuckGo also has one similar to the Google one:


https://icons.duckduckgo.com/ip3/dev.to.ico



Enter fullscreen mode


Exit fullscreen mode





Also there's one I made called Icon Horse that has some additional features:

Wasn't aware of those ones, nice to know thanks !
I would just state that Icon Horse is not free (but still a very nice tool).
Do you know if duckduckgo supports parameters, such as the size hint for example ?

To my knowledge DDG doesn‚Äôt have various customisation params available.
Icon Horse is free, but premium features cost money.

Here is yet another service: favicongrabber.com
The call looks like:


http://favicongrabber.com/api/grab/dev.to



Enter fullscreen mode


Exit fullscreen mode





The response is a JSON with all the available icons (use ?pretty=true for nice json formatting):


{
  "domain": "dev.to",
  "icons": [
    {
      "sizes": "192x192",
      "src": "https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--t7tVouP9--/c_limit,f_png,fl_progressive,q_80,w_192/https:/practicaldev-herokuapp-com.freetls.fastly.net/assets/devlogo-pwa-512.png"
    },
    ...
}



Enter fullscreen mode


Exit fullscreen mode





However, I got some gateway timeouts and trying favicongrabber.com/api/grab/stacko... currently returns:


{"error":"General API error."}



Enter fullscreen mode


Exit fullscreen mode

Cool! I found a few more
curl
   wget
   my browser's url bar
what's special about those is they didn't build useless crap to farm me for ad revenue. so no thanks, but also no thanks.
