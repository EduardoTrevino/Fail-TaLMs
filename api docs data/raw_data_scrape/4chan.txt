Welcome to the documentation for 4chan's read-only JSON API, originally launched in September of 2012.

Getting started
Data from the 4chan API is exclusively accessible from a.4cdn.org, via either http:// or https:// protocols. a.4cdn.org serves JSON representations of posts made at 4chan.org and 4channel.org boards.  All examples in the documentation for the 4chan API use https://.
CORS is supported from origins boards.4chan.org or boards.4channel.org, via http:// or https://. Requests are accepted when using the following HTTP request types:

GET
OPTIONS
HEAD

API Rules

Do not make more than one request per second.
Thread updating should be set to a minimum of 10 seconds, preferably higher.
Use If-Modified-Since when doing your requests.
Make API requests using the same protocol as the app. Only use SSL when a user is accessing your app over HTTPS.

API Terms of Service

You may not use "4chan" in the title of your application, product, or service.
You may not use the 4chan name, logo, or brand to promote your application, product, or service.
You must disclose the source of the information shown by your application, product, or service as 4chan, and provide a link.
You may not market your application, product, or service as being "official" in any way.
You may not clone 4chan or its existing features/functionality. Example: Don't suck down our JSON, host it elsewhere, and throw ads around it.
These terms are subject to change without notice.


To view a pretty-printed version of our thread, index, and catalog JSON, use JSONLint.
