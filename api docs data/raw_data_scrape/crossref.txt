Prompted by some of the signatories and organizers of the Barcelona Declaration, which Crossref supports, and with the help of our friends at CWTS Leiden, we have fast-tracked the work to include an updated set of metadata best practices in participation reports for our members....Find out more2024 July 22Metadata schema development plansIt’s been a while, here’s a metadata update and request for feedback In Spring 2023 we sent out a survey to our community with a goal of assessing what our priorities for metadata development should be - what projects are our community ready to support? Where is the greatest need? What are the roadblocks?
The intention was to help prioritize our metadata development work. There’s a lot we want to do, a lot our community needs from us, but we really want to make sure we’re focusing on the projects that will have the most immediate impact for now....Find out more2024 July 02Crossmark community consultation: What did we learn?In the first half of this year we’ve been talking to our community about post-publication changes and Crossmark. When a piece of research is published it isn’t the end of the journey—it is read, reused, and sometimes modified. That’s why we run Crossmark, as a way to provide notifications of important changes to research made after publication. Readers can see if the research they are looking at has updates by clicking the Crossmark logo....Find out more2024 July 01Celebrating five years of Grant IDs: where are we with the Crossref Grant Linking System?We’re happy to note that this month, we are marking five years since Crossref launched its Grant Linking System. The Grant Linking System (GLS) started life as a joint community effort to create ‘grant identifiers’ and support the needs of funders in the scholarly communications infrastructure.
The system includes a funder-designed metadata schema and a unique link for each award which enables connections with millions of research outputs, better reporting on the research and outcomes of funding, and a contribution to open science infrastructure....Find out more

or contact usREST APIOur publicly available REST API exposes the metadata that members deposit with Crossref when they register their content with us. And it’s not just the bibliographic metadata either: funding data, license information, full-text links, ORCID iDs, abstracts, and Crossmark updates are in members’ metadata too. You can search, facet, filter, or sample metadata from thousands of members, and the results are returned in JSON. Learn more in our REST API documentation.Numerous tools and services rely on our metadata, be they for search, annotation, sharing, or analysis. Some common uses for our REST API include:Text and data miningHelping with auditing funder mandatesIdentifying author publicationsMany familiar organizations use our metadata through this modern machine interface. Check out the API case studies from organizations like Authorea and SHARE.No sign-up is required to use the REST API, and the data can be treated as facts from members. The data is not subject to copyright, and you may use it for any purpose.Crossref generally provides metadata without restriction; however, some abstracts contained in the metadata may be subject to copyright by publishers or authors.Page owner: Patrick Polischuk   |   Last updated 2020-April-08You are CrossrefJoin the communityGet email updatesApplyMember termsFeesSponsorsStatus pageDocumentationCommunity forumLabsBlogOperations and sustainabilityGovernanceContact The content of this site is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International LicensePrivacy
