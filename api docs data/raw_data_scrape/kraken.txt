The Spot exchange Websockets API and the Kraken Futures APIs are documented separately. Our REST API is organised into publicly accessible endpoints (market data, exchange status, etc.), and private authenticated endpoints (trading, funding, user data) which require requests to be signed.
Your use of the Kraken REST API is subject to the Kraken Terms & Conditions, Privacy Notice, as well as all other applicable terms and disclosures made available on www.kraken.com.
You must seek our prior permission for any non personal commercial use of the Kraken REST API, this includes, but is not limited to, any non personal commercial use of market data, exchange status, etc. available via the publicly available endpoints. You may seek such permission by contacting marketdata@kraken.com.
SupportFurther information and FAQs may be found on the API section of our support pages. If you have trouble making any standard requests that our system permits, please send us a ticket with a full copy of the request(s) that you're attempting, including your IP address and all headers, so that we may investigate further.
Requests, Responses and ErrorsRequests
Request payloads are form-encoded (Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded), and all requests must specify a User-Agent in their headers.
Responses
Responses are JSON encoded and contain one or two top-level keys (result and error for successful requests or those with warnings, or only error for failed or rejected requests)
Example Successful Response
{
  "error": [],
  "result": {
    "status": "online",
    "timestamp": "2021-03-22T17:18:03Z"
  }
}


GET https://api.kraken.com/0/public/SystemStatus

Example Rejection
{
  "error": [
    "EGeneral:Invalid arguments:ordertype"
  ]
}

Error Details
HTTP status codes are generally not used by our API to convey information about the state of requests -- any errors or warnings are denoted in the error field of the response as described above. Status codes other than 200 indicate that there was an issue with the request reaching our servers.
error messages follow the general format <severity><category>:<error msg>[:add'l text]

severity can be either E for error or W for warning
category can be one of General, Auth, API, Query, Order, Trade, Funding, or Service
error msg can be any text string that describes the reason for the error

Additional information can be found on our support center.
AuthenticationAuthenticated requests must include both API-Key and API-Sign HTTP headers, and nonce in the request payload. otp is also required in the payload if two-factor authentication (2FA) is enabled.
Nonce and 2FAnonce
Nonce must be an always increasing, unsigned 64-bit integer, for each request that is made with a particular API key. While a simple counter would provide a valid nonce, a more usual method of generating a valid nonce is to use e.g. a UNIX timestamp in milliseconds.

Note: There is no way to reset the nonce for an API key to a lower value, so be sure to use a nonce generation method that won't produce numbers less than the previous nonce. Too many requests with invalid nonces (EAPI:Invalid nonce) can result in temporary bans. Problems can arise from requests arriving out of order due to API keys being shared across processes, or from system clock drift/recalibration. An optional "nonce window" can be configured to specify a tolerance between nonce values. Additional info can be found in our support pages.

otp
If two-factor authentication (2FA) is enabled for the API key and action in question, the one time password must be specified in the payload's otp value.
Headers and SignatureAll responses will include the x-trace-id header. This uniquely identifies your request. When contacting support, please include a trace-id where possible.
API-KeyThe "API-Key" header should contain your API key.
Security Scheme Type: API KeyHeader parameter name: API-KeyAPI-SignAuthenticated requests should be signed with the "API-Sign" header, using a signature generated with your private key, nonce, encoded payload, and URI path according to:
HMAC-SHA512 of (URI path + SHA256(nonce + POST data)) and base64 decoded secret API key

Example Signature
The following is a specific example of a signature generated with a particular private key, nonce, and payload corresponding to a new limit order (buy 1.25 XBTUSD at $37,500). If your code is generating a different signature ("API-Sign") for this example, then there is likely an issue with your application of the above methodology. Code snippets for generating the signature in Python, Golang and Node.js follow below.

Security Scheme Type: API KeyHeader parameter name: API-SignRate LimitsWe have various safeguards in place to protect against system abuse, order book manipulation, DDoS attacks, etc. For REST API requests, these are broadly organised into rate limits specific to the REST API, and rate limits which apply to any trading requests.

Note: For clients with performance sensitive applications, we strongly recommend the use of our Websockets API for minimising request latency and receiving real-time information, reducing or eliminating the need to frequently poll REST endpoints.

REST API Rate LimitsLimits
Every REST API user has a "call counter" which starts at 0. Ledger/trade history calls increase the counter by 2. All other API calls increase this counter by 1 (except AddOrder, CancelOrder which operate on a different limiter detailed further below).



Tier
Max API Counter
API Counter Decay



Starter
15
-0.33/sec


Intermediate
20
-0.5/sec


Pro
20
-1/sec


The user's counter is reduced every couple of seconds depending on their verification tier. Each API key's counter is separate, and if the counter exceeds the maximum value, subsequent calls using that API key would be rate limited. If the rate limits are reached, additional calls will be restricted for a few seconds (or possibly longer if calls continue to be made while the rate limits are active).

Note: Master accounts and subaccounts will share the same default trading rate limits as determined by the master account's tier.

Errors

"EAPI:Rate limit exceeded" if the REST API counter exceeds the user's maximum.
"EService: Throttled: [UNIX timestamp]" if there are too many concurrent requests. Try again after [timestamp].

Additional information can be found on our support center.
Matching Engine Rate LimitsLimits
Separate limits apply to the number of orders clients may have open in each pair at a time, and the speed with which they may add and cancel orders in each pair. These limits vary by the account verification tier:

Max Num Orders
Max Ratecount

Intermediate

-2.34/sec


Pro

180
-3.75/sec


Penalties
The speed is controlled by a ratecounter for each (client, pair) which starts at zero, is incremented when penalties are applied, and decremented according to the decay rates above. A penalty is added to the ratecounter for each new order placed (AddOrder) or cancelled (CancelOrder, CancelAll, CancelAllOrdersAfter) on the pair. The cancellation penalty varies according to the lifetime of the order.

** Rate limits penalty for CancelOrderBatch will be cumulative sum of individual orders penalty, accumulated upto max ratecount. In case, the cumulative penalty in the batch exceeds max ratecount, cancel requests in batch are still accepted.

Note: A client's exact ratecounter values can be monitored via the Websockets openOrders feed.

Errors

"EOrder:Orders limit exceeded" if the number of open orders in a given pair is exceeded
"EOrder:Rate limit exceeded" if the user's max ratecount is exceeded for a given pair

Note: Most changes affecting our APIs or trading engine behaviour are currently being tracked on our Websockets changelog, until these documents are combined.
Example API ClientsIn order to achieve maximum performance, security and flexibility for your particular needs, we strongly encourage the implementation of this API with your own code, and to minimise reliance on third party software.
That being said, in order to aid with rapid development and prototyping, we're in the process of producing 'official' API clients in Python and Golang that will be actively maintained, coincident with the release of newer versions of both our Websockets and REST APIs. In the meantime, our Client Engagement team has compiled a number of code snippets, examples and Postman collections that many find useful.
Third Party Software
Below are other third party API client code libraries that may be used when writing your own API client. Please keep in mind that Payward nor the third party authors are responsible for losses due to bugs or improper use of the APIs. Payward has performed an initial review of the safety of the third party code before listing them but cannot vouch for any changes added since then, or for those that may be stale. If you have concerns, please contact support.

userrefinteger <int32>  User reference id
userref is an optional user-specified integer id that can be associated with any number of orders. Many clients choose a userref corresponding to a unique integer id generated by their systems (e.g. a timestamp). However, because we don't enforce uniqueness on our side, it can also be used to easily group orders by pair, side, strategy, etc. This allows clients to more readily cancel or query information about orders in a particular group, with fewer API calls by using userref instead of our txid, where supported.
ordertyperequiredstring (ordertype)  Enum: "market" "limit" "stop-loss" "take-profit" "stop-loss-limit" "take-profit-limit" "trailing-stop" "trailing-stop-limit" "settle-position"  Order type
typerequiredstring Enum: "buy" "sell"  Order direction (buy/sell)
volumerequiredstring Order quantity in terms of the base asset

Note: Volume can be specified as 0 for closing margin orders to automatically fill the requisite quantity.

displayvolstring Used to create an iceberg order, this is the visible order quantity in terms of the base asset. The rest of the order will be hidden, although the full volume can be filled at any time by any order of that size or larger that matches in the order book. displayvol can only be used with the limit order type, must be greater than 0, and less than volume.
pairrequiredstring Asset pair id or altname
pricestring Price:

Limit price for limit orders
Trigger price for stop-loss, stop-loss-limit, take-profit, take-profit-limit, trailing-stop and trailing-stop-limit orders

Notes:

Relative Prices: Either price or price2 can be preceded by +, -, or # to specify the order price as an offset relative to the last traded price. + adds the amount to, and - subtracts the amount from the last traded price. # will either add or subtract the amount to the last traded price, depending on the direction and order type used. Prices can also be suffixed with a % to signify the relative amount as a percentage, rather than an absolute price difference.
Trailing Stops: Must use a relative price for this field, namely the + prefix, from which the direction will be automatic based on if the original order is a buy or sell (no need to use - or #). The % suffix also works for these order types to use a relative percentage price.

price2string Secondary Price:

Limit price for stop-loss-limit, take-profit-limit and trailing-stop-limit orders
Note:
Trailing Stops: Must use a relative price for this field, namely one of the + or - prefixes. This will provide the offset from the trigger price to the limit price, i.e. +0 would set the limit price equal to the trigger price. The % suffix also works for this field to use a relative percentage limit price.

triggerstring Default:  "last" Enum: "index" "last"  Price signal used to trigger stop-loss, stop-loss-limit, take-profit, take-profit-limit, trailing-stop and trailing-stop-limit orders
Notes:

This trigger type will also be used for any associated conditional close orders.
To keep triggers serviceable, the last price will be used as fallback reference price during connectivity issues with external index feeds.

leveragestring Amount of leverage desired (default: none)
reduce_onlyboolean Default:  false If true, order will only reduce a currently open position, not increase it or open a new position.
stptypestring Default:  "cancel-newest" Enum: "cancel-newest" "cancel-oldest" "cancel-both"  Self trade prevention behavior definition:

cancel-newest - if self trade is triggered, arriving order will be canceled
cancel-oldest - if self trade is triggered, resting order will be canceled
cancel-both - if self trade is triggered, both arriving and resting orders will be canceled

oflagsstring (oflags)  Comma delimited list of order flags

post post-only order (available when ordertype = limit)
fcib prefer fee in base currency (default if selling)
fciq prefer fee in quote currency (default if buying, mutually exclusive with fcib)
nompp disable market price protection for market orders
viqc  order volume expressed in quote currency. This is supported only for market orders.

timeinforcestring Default:  "GTC" Enum: "GTC" "IOC" "GTD"  Time-in-force of the order to specify how long it should remain in the order book before being cancelled. GTC (Good-'til-cancelled) is default if the parameter is omitted. IOC (immediate-or-cancel) will immediately execute the amount possible and cancel any remaining balance rather than resting in the book. GTD (good-'til-date), if specified, must coincide with a desired expiretm.
starttmstring Scheduled start time, can be specified as an absolute timestamp or as a number of seconds in the future:

0 now (default)
<n> = unix timestamp of start time
+<n> = schedule start time <n> seconds from now
Note that URL encoding of the + character changes it to a space, so please use %2b followed by the number of seconds instead of +



expiretmstring Expiration time, also can be specified as an absolute timestamp or as a number of seconds in the future:

0 no expiration (default)
<n> = unix timestamp of expiration time
+<n> = expire <n> seconds from now, minimum 5 seconds
Note that URL encoding of the + character changes it to a space, so please use %2b followed by the number of seconds instead of +



close[ordertype]string Enum: "limit" "stop-loss" "take-profit" "stop-loss-limit" "take-profit-limit" "trailing-stop" "trailing-stop-limit"  Conditional close order type 

Note: Conditional close orders are triggered by execution of the primary order in the same quantity and opposite direction, but once triggered are independent orders that may reduce or increase net position

close[price]string Conditional close order price
close[price2]string Conditional close order price2
deadlinestring RFC3339 timestamp (e.g. 2021-04-01T00:18:45Z) after which the matching engine should reject the new order request, in presence of latency or order queueing: min now() + 2 seconds, max now() + 60 seconds.

The client can send a request with a timeout (in seconds), that will start a countdown timer which will cancel all client orders when the timer expires. The client has to keep sending new requests to push back the trigger time, or deactivate the mechanism by specifying a timeout of 0. If the timer expires, all orders are cancelled and then the timer remains disabled until the client provides a new (non-zero) timeout.
The recommended use is to make a call every 15 to 30 seconds, providing a timeout of 60 seconds. This allows the client to keep the orders in place in case of a brief disconnection or transient delay, while keeping them safe in case of a network breakdown. It is also recommended to disable the timer ahead of regularly scheduled trading engine maintenance (if the timer is enabled, all orders will be cancelled when the trading engine comes back from downtime - planned or otherwise).

The different available earn products are represented by earn strategies. This corresponds to the legacy Staking/Assets. Stake/Unstake are replaced by Allocate/Deallocate.
Overview of the available endpoints under /Earn:

Strategies - list all earn strategies for which you are eligible or have a balance.
Allocations - lists the balance in your earn account for each strategy. Requires the Query Funds API key permission.
Allocate/Deallocate - allocate/deallocate to an earn strategy through an async operation. Requires the Earn Funds API key permission.
AllocateStatus/DeallocateStatus - verifies the state of the last allocation/deallocation. Requires the Earn Funds or Query Funds API key permission.

Example usage:
Determine which funds are earning rewards:

Call Strategies to obtain information about the relevant strategy. The lock_type field shows whether bonding/unbonding funds are earning yield. The relevant fields are bonding_rewards/unbonding_rewards.
Call Allocations for the relevant strategy. From the previous step, for strategies where bonding/unbonding does not earn yield, substract these balances from amount_allocated.total to determine which balances are currently earning.

Get allocatable balance:
Call /0/private/BalanceEx, subtract hold_trading amount. Remaining balance is available for allocation to a strategy.
Geo restrictions:
Some earn strategies are not available in all geographic regions. Strategies will return only strategies available to the caller.
Allocate Earn Funds Allocate funds to the Strategy.
Requires the Earn Funds API key permission.
The amount must always be defined.
This method is asynchronous. A couple of preflight checks are
performed synchronously on behalf of the method before it is dispatched
further. The client is required to poll
the result using the /0/private/Earn/AllocateStatus endpoint.
There can be only one (de)allocation request in progress for given user and
strategy at any time. While the operation is in progress:

pending attribute in /Earn/Allocations response for the strategy
  indicates that funds are being allocated,
pending attribute in /Earn/AllocateStatus response will be true.

Following specific errors within Earnings class can be returned by this
method:

Minimum allocation: EEarnings:Below min:(De)allocation operation amount less than minimum
Allocation in progress: EEarnings:Busy:Another (de)allocation for the same strategy is in progress

A note about lock_type:

instant: can be deallocated without an unbonding period. This is called flexible in the UI.
bonded: has an unbonding period. Deallocation will not happen until this period has passed.
flex: "Kraken rewards". This is earning on your spot balances where eligible. It's turned on account wide
from the UI and you cannot manually allocate to these strategies.

Requires the Query Funds API key permission.
By default all allocations are returned, even for strategies that have been
used in the past and have zero balance now. That is so that the user can see
how much was earned with given strategy in the past.
hide_zero_allocations parameter can be used to remove zero balance entries
from the output.  Paging hasn't been implemented for this method as we don't
expect the result for a particular user to be overwhelmingly large.
All amounts in the output can be denominated in a currency of user's choice
(the converted_asset parameter).
Information about when the next reward will be paid to the client is also
provided in the output.
Allocated funds can be in up to 4 states:

bonding
allocated
exit_queue (ETH only)
unbonding

Any funds in total not in bonding/unbonding are simply allocated and
earning rewards. Depending on the strategy funds in the other 3 states can
also be earning rewards. Consult the output of /Earn/Strategies to know
whether bonding/unbonding earn rewards. ETH in exit_queue still
earns rewards.
Note that for ETH, when the funds are in the exit_queue state, the
expires time given is the time when the funds will have finished
unbonding, not when they go from exit queue to unbonding.
(Un)bonding time estimate can be inaccurate right after having (de)allocated the
funds. Wait 1-2 minutes after (de)allocating to get an accurate result.
