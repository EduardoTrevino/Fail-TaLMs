  Encyclopedia API 







	ANN now provides a direct feed to the Encyclopedia data in XML format.
	There are two parts to the API.
	
	1. Reports
On the reports page you'll find a list of various dynamically-generated reports.
	Click on any of these and you'll see a "display as xml" link to get the results in XML format.
	
	
The number of rows in any report (either HTML or XML format) can be controlled with the url parameters nskip and nlist.
	For example you can get the first 50 rows with nskip=0&nlist=50, the next 50 rows with nskip=50&nlist=50, or all rows at once with nlist=all.
	Some reports accept additional parameters, like this one where type=anime limits the results to anime titles only, and name=Z limits the results to titles starting with the letter Z.
	See individual reports for details.
	
	
If you are building an application which requires a database of anime titles,
	a typical usage scenario would be to make an initial import with reports.xml?id=155&type=anime&nlist=all
	and then do a daily import of newly added titles with reports.xml?id=155&type=anime&nlist=50

2. Anime/Manga Details
	
	If you need more information than the basic details provided in the reports, use this API to fetch detailled information for each title.
	The basic syntax is https://cdn.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/api.xml?anime=id.
	Instead of anime you should use manga if you are fetching a manga's details, or title if it could be either.
	For example:
	

api.xml?anime=4658 or api.xml?title=4658 to get details of Jinki:Extend (TV)


api.xml?manga=4199 or api.xml?title=4199 to get details of Jinki:Extend (manga)


Details for a single title can contain a lot of data so please try to spare our poor servers by fetching (and then caching) details from this API only as needed.
	In a typical usage scenario, you could present to your users a list of all anime titles imported using the reports above.
	When a user needs additional info about a certain title your backend would fetch the details for that single title and cache them for a week (older titles especially tend not to change so much).
	
	
2a. Batching
	You can request details for several titles at once by specifying the anime/manga/title parameter more than once,
	or by using a slash-separated list of ids instead of a single id.
	You can also get results by name by specifying ~name instead of an id.
	Please note this does not match alternative titles, only the primary name (the one in the page title).
	For example these are all equivalent ways to get details for the 3 titles in the Jinki franchise at once:
	

api.xml?anime=4658&manga=4199&manga=11608


api.xml?anime=4658&manga=4199/11608


api.xml?title=4658/4199/11608


api.xml?title=~jinki


	Please note that you can only batch up to 50 titles at once.
	
	Terms of Service
	We provide this API free of charge but you must
	
list Anime News Network as the source of the data
include a link to the relevant Encyclopedia entry (like "full details at Anime News Network") on any page that displays anime/manga/person details

Usage Limits
	The API is rate-limited to 1 request per second per IP address;
		requests over this threshold will be delayed.
	If you would rather make 5 requests close together every 5 seconds, use nodelay.api.xml instead;
		but requests over the 1/s threshold will get a 503 error.

T・P BON Season 2 Anime Series Review


Aug  3, 12:00
1 comment


              anime



T・P BON is an upbeat, (mostly) optimistic sci-fi adventure that doesn't shy away from the darkness of human history yet celebrates and uplifts the lives of the "little" people.
― This second half of studio Bones' adaptation of Doraemon co-creator Fujiko F Fujio's 1976-86 manga maintains the same light educational tone as its first, mixed with occasional graphic (historically appropriate) bloody viole...

In just twenty years, ASIAN KUNG-FU GENERATION has gone from singing for anime to inspiring its characters.
― In 2003, ASIAN KUNG-FU GENERATION exploded into the anime scene with “Haruka Kanata,” the second theme song for the popular Naruto anime.

Nintendo World Championships: NES Edition is the best execution of its core concept as it could ever be: a celebration of speedrunning and friendly competition between gamers.
