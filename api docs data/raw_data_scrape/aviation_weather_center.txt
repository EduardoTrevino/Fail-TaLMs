The weather database currently allows access to the previous 15 days of data.Please keep requests limited in scope and frequency. Maximum results per query apply as well as rate limiting against frequent requests. For larger queries, consider using the cache files.CacheAccess to current observations and forecasts in one file. Use of these files is recommended instead of making excessively large or frequent custom queries.
