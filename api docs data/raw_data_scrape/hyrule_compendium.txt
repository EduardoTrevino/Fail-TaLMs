Hyrule Compendium API
An API serving data on all in-game items and regions in Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom





Concept
The Hyrule compendium is an encyclopedia of all the in-game interactive items in the world of Hyrule. With this brilliant API, you can access its data and embed it into your own application.
You can see a specific item, all items in a category, or all data in our database.
Here is an example request and response, retrieving data on the white-maned lynel:
$ curl https://botw-compendium.herokuapp.com/api/v3/entry/white-maned_lynel
{
    "data": {
        "name": "white-maned lynel",
        "id": 123,
        "category": "monsters",
        "description": "These fearsome monsters have lived in Hyrule since ancient times. Their ability to breathe fire makes White-Maned Lynels among the toughest of the species; each one of their attacks is an invitation to the grave. There are so few eyewitness accounts of this breed because a White-Maned Lynel is not one to let even simple passersby escape with their lives.",
        "common_locations":[
            "Hyrule Field",
            "Hebra Mountains"
        ]
        "drops": [
            "lynel horn",
            "lynel hoof",
            "lynel guts"
        ],
        "image": "https://botw-compendium.herokuapp.com/api/v2/entry/white-maned_lynel/image"
    }
}
