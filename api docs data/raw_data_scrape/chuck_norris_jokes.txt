Chuck Norris facts are satirical factoids about martial artist and actor Chuck Norris that have become an
                Internet phenomenon and as a result have become widespread in popular culture. The 'facts' are normally
                absurd hyperbolic claims about Norris' toughness, attitude, virility, sophistication, and
                masculinity.
Chuck Norris facts have spread around the world, leading not only to translated versions, but also
                spawning localized versions mentioning country-specific advertisements and other Internet phenomena.
                Allusions are also sometimes made to his use of roundhouse kicks to perform seemingly any task, his
                large amount of body hair with specific regard to his beard, and his role in the action television
                series Walker, Texas Ranger.
