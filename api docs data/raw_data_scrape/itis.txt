                                The ITIS Web Services provide the ability to search and retrieve data from ITIS by providing access to the data behind the
                                ITIS web site







                                Each part of the web services is provided by a web service
                                API, which defines the name, input to, and output from the service
                                for a particular data request.
                                






                                This page lists all the ITIS Web Service APIs with a
                                description that includes the information provided by the API, the
                                input needed to get data from the API, and the data that is
                                returned by the API.
                                






                                ITIS also provides a Web Service Description Language (WSDL)
                                document that fully describes the ITIS Web Service. This document
                                can be used to create clients that access the service.
                                






                                The following web service APIs are provided:
