RSS Jobicy – This interface allows information to be received from the database jobicy.com. You do not need to know in detail how the base is constructed and from which table and field types it consists of. It is enough that API-request “knows” it. The request syntax and the type of data being returned are strictly determined by the service itself.

With this RSS, now you can build job apps with our data feed. Listings of jobs can be derived from the following endpoints:
