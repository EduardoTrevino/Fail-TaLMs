Frequently Asked Questions




How can you estimate the age of a name?






Names go through cycles of popularity resulting in a correlation between first names and birth years. With our datebase of more than one billion people, we can give statistical probablities on the age of person based on their name.



How does the tool handle names from different cultural or ethnic backgrounds?






Naming conventions can be different across countries and cultures. We support scoping a classification to a specific country which will often improve the accuracy of your results.



Do you offer any free plans?






We do - and you won't even have to sign up. You can process 100 names/day with our API or CSV tool and we'll limit you based on your IP.



Can the tool be integrated with our customer relationship management (CRM) systems?






There's plenty of ways to start integrating our prediction services with your existing tools. The easiest way to get started is with our no-code, official Zapier app.



What kind of customer support do you offer?






We're available on email to answer questions and help you out in integrating gender classification as part of your workflow. Reach out at info@genderize.io.
