    Nominatim API
  











Overview
Nominatim API

Attention
The current version of Nominatim implements two different search frontends:
the old PHP frontend and the new Python frontend. They have a very similar
API but differ in some implementation details. These are marked in the
documentation as [Python-only] or [PHP-only].
https://nominatim.openstreetmap.org implements the Python frontend.
So users should refer to the [Python-only] comments.

This section describes the API V1 of the Nominatim web service. The
service offers the following endpoints:

/search - search OSM objects by name or type
/reverse - search OSM object by their location
/lookup - look up address details for OSM objects by their ID
/status - query the status of the server
/deletable - list objects that have been deleted in OSM but are held
                    back in Nominatim in case the deletion was accidental
/polygons - list of broken polygons detected by Nominatim
/details - show internal details for an object (for debugging only)
