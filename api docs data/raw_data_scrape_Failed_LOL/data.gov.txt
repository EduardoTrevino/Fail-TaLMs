Here's how you know










The .gov means it's official.

                Federal government websites often end in .gov or .mil. Before
                sharing sensitive information, make sure you're on a federal
                government site.
              






The site is secure.

                The https:// ensures that you are connecting to
                the official website and that any information you provide is
                encrypted and transmitted securely.

Mission

          The United States Governmentâ€™s open data site is designed to unleash the power of government open data to
          inform
            decisions by the public and policymakers, drive innovation and economic activity, achieve
            agency missions, and
          strengthen the foundation of an open and transparent government.
        


            About Us 
















Data.gov at 15

          On May 21, 2009, Data.gov launched with a total of 47 datasets. After the landmark 2013 Open Data Policy
          required agencies to create comprehensive data inventories and public data listings, the site grew to 115,000+
          datasets from 88 organizations by 2015. These requirements were enacted into the Open Government Data Act in
          2019. Today, Data.gov is nearing 300,000 datasets and dataset collections in the catalog, harvested from over
          100 organizations, and counts over a million monthly pageviews from people like you, looking to discover that
          information. In 2024, Data.gov continues its commitment to open government data and transparency. Thank you
          for 15 years!
