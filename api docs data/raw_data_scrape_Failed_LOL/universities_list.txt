Do you need a list of universities and their domain names? You found it!
This package includes a JSON file that contains domains, names and countries of most of the universities of the world.
Example usecases:

You can create a validation script that checks the email domain.
You can automatically generate a user's country and university by looking at their emails.

You can use this data source in three ways:

Use the JSON file as your data source and do whatever you like with your favourite programming language.
Use free hosted-API.
Use the tiny Python app to serve a fast API that you can query data.

1 - Using the Data Source
The whole data source is located in the world_universities_and_domains.json file. It is just a list of dictionaries in the following format:
[
	...
	{
	    "alpha_two_code": "TR",
	    "country": "Turkey",
	    "state-province": null,
	    "domains": [
	        "sabanciuniv.edu",
	        "sabanciuniv.edu.tr"
	    ],
	    "name": "Sabanci University",
	    "web_pages": [
	        "http://www.sabanciuniv.edu/",
	        "http://www.sabanciuniv.edu.tr/"
	    ],
	},
	...
]

If you want a smaller final payload and only need a subset of countries, run
filter.py $country1 [Optional: $country2]
from the root directory to return
filtered_world_universities_and_domains.json

NOTE: Some universities use a format like [user]@[department].[domain], but this list only contains the [domain] portion.
For example, an email address might be [student]@cs.usc.edu, and this list will contain 'usc.edu', the domain for the
University of Southern California. Take this into consideration if using this list for email address validation.
2 - Using The Hosted API
This is the easiest method if you're making a small project or just want to discover the data without any hassle.
It is sponsored by Hipo and free. If you have a big project, please host it on your own server.
Some example searches:

http://universities.hipolabs.com
http://universities.hipolabs.com/search?name=middle
http://universities.hipolabs.com/search?name=middle&country=turkey

The hosted API uses university-domains-list-api package.
3 - Using the built-in API on your server
You can access the python API via university-domains-list-api
Contribution
Please contribute to this list! We need your support to keep this list up-to-date.
Do not hesitate to fix any wrong data. It is extremely easy. Just open a PR, or create an issue.
