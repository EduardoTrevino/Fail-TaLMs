A really micro micro-service for advanced math.
Newton does anything from numerical calculation to symbolic math parsing.
How does it work?

Send a GET request to newton with a url-encoded math expression and your preferred operation.
Get back a JSON response with your problem solved.

Show me
Let's find the derivative of x^2.
So, we send a request to the newton url saying just that:
-> https://newton.now.sh/api/v2/derive/x%5E2 (Note the url-encoded ^)
Now, we get the following response:
{
  "operation":"derive",
  "expression":"x^2",
  "result":"2 x"
}

It's that simple!
Get Started

Send a GET request to newton.

https://newton.now.sh/api/v2/:operation/:expression

Note: :operation is the math operation that you want to perform. :expression is the url-encoded math expression on which you want to operate. View available operation endpoints below!

That's it! You'll be returned a JSON object with the operation you requested, the expression you provided, and the result of the operation performed on the expression.

View available endpoints:



Operation

Simplify
/simplify/2^2+2(2)

Factor
/factor/x^2 + 2x
x (x + 2)


Derive
/derive/x^2+2x

Integrate
/integrate/x^2+2x

Find 0's

Logarithm

Keep in mind:
To find the tangent line of a function at a certain x value,
send the request as c|f(x) where c is the given x value and f(x) is the function expression, the separator is a vertical bar '|'. See the table above for an example request.
To find the area under a function, send the request as c:d|f(x) where c is the starting x value, d is the ending x value, and f(x) is the function under which you want the curve between the two x values.
To compute fractions, enter expressions as numerator(over)denominator. For example, to process 2/4 you must send in your expression as 2(over)4. The result expression will be in standard math notation (1/2, 3/4).
What have people made?
Some cool apps and libraries made with Newton include the following:

Newton Bot (Coming soon!)
Newton Python Wrapper
Newton Clay Microservice
PyNewtonMath (Python 3 Wrapper)
NewtonMath.js (Native Node.js Wrapper)
goNewton (GoLang Wrapper)
newtonmath (Rust Wrapper)
Newton Telegram Bot
Ming Newton
Hopefully more to come!
