count
to perform a count on a data request. Count uses the same parameters as the query method, and is availablein these formats: plain text (default), geojson, and xml.
https://earthquake.usgs.gov/fdsnws/event/1/count?format=geojson
https://earthquake.usgs.gov/fdsnws/event/1/count?starttime=2014-01-01&endtime=2014-01-02
query
to submit a data request. See the parameters section for supported url parameters.
https://earthquake.usgs.gov/fdsnws/event/1/query?format=geojson&starttime=2014-01-01&endtime=2014-01-02
https://earthquake.usgs.gov/fdsnws/event/1/query?format=xml&starttime=2014-01-01&endtime=2014-01-02&minmagnitude=5
version
request full service version number
https://earthquake.usgs.gov/fdsnws/event/1/version

starttime	String	NOW - 30 days	Limit to events on or after the specified start time. NOTE: All times use ISO8601 Date/Time format. Unless a timezone is specified, UTC is assumed.
updatedafter	String	null	Limit to events updated after the specified time. NOTE: All times use ISO8601 Date/Time format. Unless a timezone is specified, UTC is assumed.
Location
Requests that use both rectangle and circle will return the intersection, which may be empty, use with caution.

Rectangle
Requests may use any combination of these parameters.

parameter	type	default	description
minlatitude	Decimal [-90,90] degrees	-90	Limit to events with a latitude larger than the specified minimum. NOTE: min values must be less than max values.
minlongitude	Decimal [-360,360] degrees	-180	Limit to events with a longitude larger than the specified minimum. NOTE: rectangles may cross the date line by using a minlongitude < -180 or maxlongitude > 180. NOTE: min values must be less than max values.
maxlatitude	Decimal [-90,90] degrees	90	Limit to events with a latitude smaller than the specified maximum. NOTE: min values must be less than max values.
maxlongitude	Decimal [-360,360] degrees	180	Limit to events with a longitude smaller than the specified maximum. NOTE: rectangles may cross the date line by using a minlongitude < -180 or maxlongitude > 180. NOTE: min values must be less than max values.
Circle
Requests must include all of latitude, longitude, and maxradius to perform a circle search.

parameter	type	default	description
latitude	Decimal [-90,90] degrees	null	Specify the latitude to be used for a radius search.
longitude	Decimal [-180,180] degrees	null	Specify the longitude to be used for a radius search.
maxradius	Decimal [0, 180] degrees	180	Limit to events within the specified maximum number of degrees from the geographic point defined by the latitude and longitude parameters. NOTE: This option is mutually exclusive with maxradiuskm and specifying both will result in an error.
maxradiuskm	Decimal [0, 20001.6] km	20001.6	Limit to events within the specified maximum number of kilometers from the geographic point defined by the latitude and longitude parameters. NOTE: This option is mutually exclusive with maxradius and specifying both will result in an error.
Other
parameter	type	default	description
catalog	String	null	Limit to events from a specified catalog. Use the Catalogs Method to find available catalogs. NOTE: when catalog and contributor are omitted, the most preferred information from any catalog or contributor for the event is returned.
contributor	String	null	Limit to events contributed by a specified contributor. Use the Contributors Method to find available contributors. NOTE: when catalog and contributor are omitted, the most preferred information from any catalog or contributor for the event is returned.
eventid	String	null	Select a specific event by ID; event identifiers are data center specific. NOTE: Selecting a specific event implies includeallorigins, includeallmagnitudes, and, additionally, associated moment tensor and focal-mechanisms are included.
includeallmagnitudes	Boolean	false	Specify if all magnitudes for the event should be included, default is data center dependent but is suggested to be the preferred magnitude only. NOTE: because magnitudes and origins are strongly associated, this parameter is interchangeable with includeallmagnitudes
includeallorigins	Boolean	false	Specify if all origins for the event should be included, default is data center dependent but is suggested to be the preferred origin only. NOTE: because magnitudes and origins are strongly associated, this parameter is interchangable with includeallmagnitudes
includearrivals	Boolean	false	Specify if phase arrivals should be included. NOTE: NOT CURRENTLY IMPLEMENTED
includedeleted	Boolean, or "only"	false	Specify if deleted products and events should be included. The value only returns only deleted events.
Deleted events otherwise return the HTTP status 409 Conflict.
