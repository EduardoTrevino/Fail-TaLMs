Hyrule Compendium API
An API serving data on all in-game items and regions in Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom
Concept
The Hyrule compendium is an encyclopedia of all the in-game interactive items in the world of Hyrule. With this brilliant API, you can access its data and embed it into your own application.

Here is an example request and response, retrieving data on the white-maned lynel:

$ curl https://botw-compendium.herokuapp.com/api/v3/compendium/entry/white-maned_lynel
{
    "data": {
        "name": "white-maned lynel",
        "id": 123,
        "category": "monsters",
        "description": "These fearsome monsters have lived in Hyrule since ancient times. Their ability to breathe fire makes White-Maned Lynels among the toughest of the species; each one of their attacks is an invitation to the grave. There are so few eyewitness accounts of this breed because a White-Maned Lynel is not one to let even simple passersby escape with their lives.",
        "common_locations":[
            "Hyrule Field",
            "Hebra Mountains"
        ]
        "drops": [
            "lynel horn",
            "lynel hoof",
            "lynel guts"
        ],
        "image": "https://botw-compendium.herokuapp.com/api/v3/compendium/entry/white-maned_lynel/image"
    }
}

Compendium API
The /compendium endpoint serves data on creatures, equipment, materials, monsters, and treasure.

Tears of the Kingdom entries
You can configure which game to query by setting URL parameter game. If game is not set, it defaults to Breath of the Wild. If it is set to 1 or botw, Breath of the Wild is queried. If game is set to 2 or totk, Tears of the Kingdom is queried.

Example URLs for Breath of the Wild:

https://botw-compendium.herokuapp.com/api/v3/compendium/entry/123
https://botw-compendium.herokuapp.com/api/v3/compendium/entry/123?game=1
https://botw-compendium.herokuapp.com/api/v3/compendium/entry/123?game=botw
Example URLs for Tears of the Kingdom:

https://botw-compendium.herokuapp.com/api/v3/compendium/entry/123?game=2
https://botw-compendium.herokuapp.com/api/v3/compendium/entry/123?game=totk
NOTE: If the game paramater is defined and is not 1, 2, botw, totk, you will recieve a 400 status code.

Images
This API also serves images of each entry. Each compendium entry has the field image. Its value of image is a link to the entry's image in a 280x280 pixel PNG format. The image links follow this schema:

https://botw-compendium.herokuapp.com/api/v3/compendium/entry/<entry>/image
<entry> can be either the entry's ID or name. For example, the white-maned lynel's image could be retrieved from either of the two links:

https://botw-compendium.herokuapp.com/api/v3/compendium/entry/lynel/image
https://botw-compendium.herokuapp.com/api/v3/compendium/entry/121/image
NOTE: You do not have to make a request to /entry/<entry> every time you want an image! Entry image links are guaranteed to be in the format /entry/<entry>/image.

They can be referenced just as you would reference any other image from the web. For example, using HTML:

<img src="https://botw-compendium.herokuapp.com/api/v3/compendium/entry/lynel/image">
Results in:


NOTE: Master mode entry images use the format: /master_mode/entry/<entry>/image.

WARNING: Tears of the Kingdom images are not yet supported. It is in the roadmap.
