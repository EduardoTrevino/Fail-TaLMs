API
icanhazdadjoke.com can be used as an API for fetching a random joke, a specific joke, or searching for jokes in a variety of formats.

Calling the API
Authentication
No authentication is required to use the icanhazdadjoke.com API. Enjoy :)

API response format
All API endpoints follow their respective browser URLs, but we adjust the response formatting to be more suited for an API based on the provided HTTP Accept header.

Accepted Accept headers:

text/html - HTML response (default response format)
application/json - JSON response
text/plain - Plain text response
Note: Requests made via curl which do not set an Accept header will respond with text/plain by default.
Custom user agent
If you intend on using the icanhazdadjoke.com API we kindly ask that you set a custom User-Agent header for all requests.

Setting a custom User-Agent header for your code will help us be able to better monitor the usage of the API and identify potential bad actors.


A good user agent should include the name of the library or website that is accessing the API along with a URL/e-email where someone can be contacted regarding the library/website.

For example: curl -H "User-Agent: My Library (https://github.com/username/repo)" https://icanhazdadjoke.com/
