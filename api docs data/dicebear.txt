HTTP-API
Our HTTP API is probably the easiest way to use DiceBear. Thanks to our sponsor bunny.net it is lightning fast worldwide. You can use our official instance or run your own. Yes, the API is also OpenSource!

Usage
Use the following address and replace <styleName> with your preferred avatar style (camelCase). Every official avatar style is supported.

INFO

We provide a large number of avatar styles from different artists. The avatar styles are licensed under different licenses that the artists can choose themselves. For a quick overview we have created an license overview for you.

Options
Options can be passed via the query string. For example, you can set a seed like this:

https://api.dicebear.com/9.x/pixel-art/svg?seed=John
preview
https://api.dicebear.com/9.x/pixel-art/svg?seed=Jane
preview
TIP

If you want to pass more options, you connect them with a & as usual with query strings.

Array options
Array values are separated by a comma. For example, the URL could look like this if you want to provide the PRNG with several hair styles in addition to the seed. Note that the avatar styles provide different options. In this example, we use the Pixel Art avatar style.

https://api.dicebear.com/9.x/pixel-art/svg?seed=John&hair=short01,short02,short03,short04,short05

File format
The API supports SVG, PNG, JPG, WebP, AVIF and JSON. We recommend using SVG if possible! SVG is the more modern format, scales indefinitely, and requires less traffic. Because the PNG, JPG, WebP and AVIF formats put more load on the API, the size is limited to 256x256. PNG, JPG, WebP and AVIF also have a lower rate limit.

PNG, JPG, WebP and AVIF use the Noto Sans font and currently supports the following subsets: cyrillic, cyrillic-ext, devanagari, greek, greek-ext, japanese, korean, latin, latin-ext, simplified-chinese, thai and vietnamese.
