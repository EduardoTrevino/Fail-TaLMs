Download Individual Disclosures
For downloading individual pieces of information, there are two primary folders where information is store. These two folders are data/ and disclosure_docs/.

All data will be accessed via the main data URL at https://house-stock-watcher-data.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com.

You can get the list of available disclosures by fetching the endpoint of https://house-stock-watcher-data.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/data/filemap.xml

Why is there no traditional API? That is because this service is statically hosted and cannot support POST requests or do any processing besides serving a file. This is the most cost effective option to run this service - as I run it at my own cost.

Note:You can just skip these two steps and grab https://house-stock-watcher-data.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/data/all_transactions.json. This file will only include the transactions that have been transcribed. The below method just indiciates that a disclosure occured that day, but not that the transaction data is available, as it may not have been transcribed yet.

Here is an example in Javascript of fetching the filemap.xml file.


  fetch('https://house-stock-watcher-data.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/data/filemap.xml')
    .then((response) => response.text())
    .then((response) => {
      const parser = new DOMParser()
      const xml = parser.parseFromString(response, 'text/xml')
      const results = [].slice.call( xml.getElementsByTagName('Key') ).filter((key) => key.textContent.includes('.json'))
      const files = results.map(file => file.textContent.split('/')[1])
    })
    .catch((response) => {
      console.log(response)
    })

    // results ['data/transaction_report_for_01_01_2021.json',
    'data/transaction_report_for_01_02_2021.json',
    ...,
    'data/transaction_report_for_12_31_2021.json'] 
  
You can then get the JSON for a single days disclosure by easily fetching the file found in the Key tag.


  fetch('https://house-stock-watcher-data.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/<your_transaction_report_for_x_x_xxxx>.json')
    .then((response) => response.json())
    .then((response) => {
      // here is your json response for that day. Each object is a distinct document filed that day.
      // Each object has a 'transactions' key that will contain all the trade information on that day.
    })
    .catch((response) => {
      console.log(response)
    })
