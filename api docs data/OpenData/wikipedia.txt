Commons analytics
Commons analytics provides data about the usage of categories and media files on Wikimedia Commons. This data is focused on categories associated with contributions from galleries, libraries, archives, and museums (GLAM).

Available data
Because of data size and complexity, Commons analytics data is only available for:

categories on the allow list
subcategories of allowed categories, up to seven steps from the allowed category on the category tree
media files directly associated with any of these categories or subcategories
To learn more about the underlying dataset and how to add a category to the allow list, see Commons Impact Metrics on Wikitech.

Response properties
For details about response properties, see the data model documentation on Wikitech.
