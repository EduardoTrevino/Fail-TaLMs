    "description": "h2.A police service for everyone\n\t\n\tLeicestershire Constabulary provides a policing service to the people of Leicester, Leicestershire and Rutland 24-hours a day, 365-days of the year.\n\nThe area we are responsible for covers over 2,500 square kilometres (over 965 square miles) and has a population of nearly one million. There is a rich diversity of communities all with their own policing needs.\n\nMany steps have been taken to bring policing back into the very heart of local communities. This has included the replacement of older, larger or out-of-town police buildings with modern, self-contained local policing units in the very centre of local communities.\n\nEach of the 15 local policing units is headed by an inspector whose responsibility is to ensure that their area receives a 24-hour policing service.\n\nTo help them provide this service they are supported by specialist departments such as the dog section, the scientific support department and the East Midlands air support unit.\n\nRather than waiting for crimes to be committed, we are working more and more to plan operations and target criminals. Many of these operations, which are aimed at tackling specific problems, involve working in partnership with local residents and other agencies and have proved to be very successful.\n\nOver the years we have forged close working relationships with local communities, other organisations and agencies and we continue to develop and strengthen these partnerships, working together to fight crime and improve the quality of life for everyone.",

Street-level crimes
Crimes at street-level; either within a 1 mile radius of a single point, or within a custom area.

The street-level crimes returned in the API are only an approximation of where the actual crimes occurred, they are not the exact locations. See the about page for more information about location anonymisation.

If you're allowing users to search for locations in Scotland, please make it clear that, since only the British Transport Police provide data for Scotland, crime levels may appear much lower than they really are.

Request parameters
Specific point
lat	Latitude of the requested crime area
lng	Longitude of the requested crime area
date	Optional. (YYYY-MM) Limit results to a specific month.
The latest month will be shown by default
Custom area
poly	The lat/lng pairs which define the boundary of the custom area
date	Optional. (YYYY-MM) Limit results to a specific month.
The latest month will be shown by default
If a custom area contains more than 10,000 crimes, the API will return a 503 status code.

The poly parameter is formatted in lat/lng pairs, separated by colons:

[lat],[lng]:[lat],[lng]:[lat],[lng]
The first and last coordinates need not be the same — they will be joined by a straight line once the request is made.

The API will return a 400 status code in response to a GET request longer than 4094 characters. For submitting particularly complex poly parameters, consider using POST instead.

Crime category
You can provide any crime category as part of the request URL. In the examples below, we use all-crime.

Stop and searches by area
Stop and searches at street-level; either within a 1 mile radius of a single point, or within a custom area.

The stop and searches returned in the API, like the crimes, are only an approximation of where the actual stop and searches occurred, they are not the exact locations. See the about page for more information about location anonymisation.

Request parameters
Specific point
lat	Latitude of the centre of the desired area
lng	Longitude of the centre of the desired area
date	Optional. (YYYY-MM) Limit results to a specific month.
The latest month will be shown by default
Custom area
poly	The lat/lng pairs which define the boundary of the custom area
date	Optional. (YYYY-MM) Limit results to a specific month.
The latest month will be shown by default
The poly parameter is formatted in lat/lng pairs, separated by colons:

[lat],[lng]:[lat],[lng]:[lat],[lng]
The first and last coordinates need not be the same — they will be joined by a straight line once the request is made.

The API will return a 400 status code in response to a GET request longer than 4094 characters. For submitting particularly complex poly parameters, consider using POST instead.

Example request
Specific point
https://data.police.uk/api/stops-street?lat=52.629729&lng=-1.131592&date=2018-06

Stop and searches by force
Stop and searches reported by a particular force.

The stop and searches returned in the API, like the crimes, are only an approximation of where the actual stop and searches occurred, they are not the exact locations. See the about page for more information about location anonymisation.

Request parameters
force	The force ID of the force to get stop and searches for
date	Optional. (YYYY-MM) Limit results to a specific month.
The latest month will be shown by default, even if no data is available for that force in that month; use the availability API method to pick a date if this is significant for you
