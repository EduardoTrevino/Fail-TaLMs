The NHTSA Product Information Catalog Vehicle Listing (vPIC) Application Programming Interface (API) provides different ways to gather information on Vehicles and their specifications. The vPIC Dataset is populated using the information submitted by the Motor Vehicle manufacturers through the 565 submittals. All the information on how a VIN is assigned by the manufacturer is captured in this catalog and used to decode a VIN and extract vehicle information.

Users/Applications attempting to use vPIC APIs will be controlled by an automated traffic rate control mechanism to ensure optimal performance of the NHTSA websites and minimize adverse impact to our users.

API Methods
Output Format
Decode VIN
/vehicles/DecodeVin/5UXWX7C5*BA?format=xml&modelyear=2011
XML CSV JSON
Less Information
The Decode VIN API will decode the VIN and the decoded output will be made available in the format of Key-value pairs. The IDs (VariableID and ValueID) represent the unique ID associated with the Variable/Value. In case of text variables, the ValueID is not applicable. Model Year in the request allows for the decoding to specifically be done in the current, or older (pre-1980), model year ranges. It is recommended to always send in the model year. This API also supports partial VIN decoding (VINs that are less than 17 characters). In this case, the VIN will be decoded partially with the available characters. In case of partial VINs, a "*" could be used to indicate the unavailable characters. The 9th digit is not necessary.
Decode VIN (flat format)
/vehicles/DecodeVinValues/5UXWX7C5*BA?format=xml&modelyear=2011
XML CSV JSON
Less Information
The Decode VIN Flat Format API will decode the VIN and the decoded output will be made available in a flat file format. Model Year in the request allows for the decoding to specifically be done in the current, or older (pre-1980), model year ranges. It is recommended to always send in the model year. This API also supports partial VIN decoding (VINs that are less than 17 characters). In this case, the VIN will be decoded partially with the available characters. In case of partial VINs, a "*" could be used to indicate the unavailable characters.
Decode VIN Extended
/vehicles/DecodeVinExtended/5UXWX7C5*BA?format=json&modelyear=2011
XML CSV JSON
Less Information
This is exactly like the Decode VIN method but provides additional information on variables related to other NHTSA programs like NCSA etc.
