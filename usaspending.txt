The USAspending Application Programming Interface (API)
The USAspending API (Application Programming Interface) allows the public to access comprehensive U.S. government spending data.
The data include spending on awards (e.g., who received federal contracts or grants, geographic breakdowns, agency breakdowns, and much more). The data also include account-level such as federal employee compensation. You can learn more about the data and the federal law that requires it to be publicly accessible (the DATA Act) at http://fedspendingtransparency.github.io.
