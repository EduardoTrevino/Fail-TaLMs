Launch Library 2

                Rocket launches, space events and crewed spaceflight
            

                The Launch Library 2 API is the official successor of the popular Launch Library API. It keeps its core features whilst also including everything the broader Space Launch Now API had to offer. The result is a large database delivering a more complete experience for each rocket launch and space event. The philosophy behind the API also remains unchanged : the entire database is accessible to everyone, for free.

Launches

                    We track all orbital launches and a number of popular suborbital launches. Generally we will track all suborbital launches which aim to reach “space” or the Karman line and are live streamed, although, we will also occasionally track others by popular demand. The endpoint has a variety of filters and parameters, such as launch service provider, launcher config or spacecraft.

Events

                    These are typically space events which aren’t covered by the standard launches. These events could be spacecraft landings, engine tests or spacewalks. The endpoint has a search filter.

Agencies

                    These are agencies involved in spaceflight that are somehow connected to data in other parts of the API. These could be launch service providers, space agencies or rocket manufacturers. The endpoint has a variety of filters and parameters, such as type or country code.

Expeditions

                    These are expeditions that have been made to space stations. The endpoint has a variety of filters and parameters, such as name or space station.

Dockings

                    These are docking events that have occurred between a spacecraft and a space station. This is intended to track visiting vehicles, both crewed and uncrewed. The endpoint has a variety of filters and parameters, such as space station or docking location.

Launch Vehicles

                    This contains rocket configurations, such as ‘Falcon 9 Block 5’. We only have launch vehicles which are used by our launch objects, we don’t have launch vehicles which are used in launches we don’t track. The endpoint has a variety of filters and parameters, such as name, family or agency.

Reusable First Stages

                    We track first rocket stages when a launch vehicle can be used more than once such as the Falcon 9 cores used by SpaceX. The endpoint has a variety of filters and parameters, such as serial number or flight number.

Spacecraft

                    This contains a list of spacecraft configurations past, present and future, such as the “Mercury” or “Dragon” capsules. The endpoint has a variety of filters and parameters, such as name or status.

Locations

                    This contains a list of all locations where launch vehicles have flown from. These include locations such as Cape Canaveral, Florida and Kourou, French Guiana. The endpoint has a variety of filters and parameters, such as country code and name.

Pads

                    This contains a list of all pads where launch vehicles have flown from. This endpoint is similar to that of the location endpoint, however, is more specific and contains information on the individual pads at each location. An example of this pad would be 'Space Launch Complex 40', which is located in Cape Canaveral. The endpoint has a variety of filters and parameters, such as location id and name.
