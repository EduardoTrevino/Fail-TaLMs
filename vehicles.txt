		The NHTSA Product Information Catalog Vehicle Listing (vPIC) Application Programming Interface (API) provides different ways to gather information on Vehicles and their specifications. The vPIC Dataset is populated using the information submitted by the Motor Vehicle manufacturers through the 565 submittals. All the information on how a VIN is assigned by the manufacturer is captured in this catalog and used to decode a VIN and extract vehicle information.
	
Users/Applications attempting to use vPIC APIs will be controlled by an automated traffic rate control mechanism to ensure optimal performance of the NHTSA websites and minimize adverse impact to our users.

Click here to see examples in Multiple Languages.
	

Standalone database
A standalone vPIC Database is now available for developers to implement VIN decode on their end instead of calling or APIs. 
			Please click the Download button below to download the vPIC database as a backup file created using MS SQL Server 2019. 



				Download
			
			("vPICList_lite_2024_07.bak.zip" updated on 07/13/2024, file size: 166 MB)
		



			Once downloaded, you can decode a VIN by calling the “spVINDecode” stored procedure as below
			EXEC [dbo].[spVinDecode] @v = N'3535353', @year = 2020
@v parameter is required – Please pass the VIN that needs to be decoded
			@year parameter is optional – Please pass the Vehicle's Model Year (if available), if not supplied procedure will try to deduct that information from the VIN
		



API Methods


Output Format



Decode VIN


/vehicles/DecodeVin/5UXWX7C5*BA?format=xml&modelyear=2011


XML
CSV
JSON




More Information
Less Information

					The Decode VIN API will decode the VIN and the decoded output will be made available in the format of Key-value pairs.
					The IDs (VariableID and ValueID) represent the unique ID associated with the Variable/Value.
					In case of text variables, the ValueID is not applicable.
					Model Year in the request allows for the decoding to specifically be done in the current, or older (pre-1980),
					model year ranges. It is recommended to always send in the model year.
					This API also supports partial VIN decoding (VINs that are less than 17 characters).
					In this case, the VIN will be decoded partially with the available characters. In case of partial VINs,
					a "*" could be used to indicate the unavailable characters. The 9th digit is not necessary.
				




Decode VIN (flat format)


/vehicles/DecodeVinValues/5UXWX7C5*BA?format=xml&modelyear=2011


XML
CSV
JSON




More Information
Less Information

					The Decode VIN Flat Format API will decode the VIN and the decoded output will be made available in a flat file format.
					Model Year in the request allows for the decoding to specifically be done in the current, or older (pre-1980),
					model year ranges. It is recommended to always send in the model year.
					This API also supports partial VIN decoding (VINs that are less than 17 characters).
					In this case, the VIN will be decoded partially with the available characters. In case of partial VINs,
					a "*" could be used to indicate the unavailable characters.
